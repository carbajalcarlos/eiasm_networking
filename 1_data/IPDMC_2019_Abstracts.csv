This assertion, however, remains understudied. Little is known as to how to evolve business models according to societal changing needs where the social capital is mostly weak.
Research in the area has focused on new ideas and on how these improve the life of the poor by offering employment and business opportunities (Simanis and Hart, 2008). However, the emphasis has been on external factors that influence new social business model innovation. The social business model like microfinance programme can be described as a system of interconnected and interdependent health related activities that determines the way the communities functions in concert with its stakeholders (i.e. women, families, career, policy makers, health workers and so on). In other words, a business model is a bundle of specific activities – an activity system – conducted to satisfy the perceived needs of the community. It specifies which parties within or as social partners supporting the community (women) conduct which activities, and how these activities are linked to each other (Amit and Zott, 2012, Zott and Amit, 2010).
The successful microfinance business model which manage to create social and economic value over extended periods of time successfully shape, adopt and renew their business model to fuel such value creation. This paper aims to investigate how social capital development of community-enabled business model to evolve in order to achieve social value creation to the society (see Figure 1). As such, we aim to enrich the discussion on the need to nurture relationships at the Bottom of the pyramid- BOP and develop social capital in BOP communities beyond the emphasis on traditional economic remedies for poverty alleviation by introducing a new business model (e.g. Ansari et al., 2012). We used three dimensions of social capital to develop our framework (Nahapiet and Ghoshal, 1998):
1. the structural dimension (configurations and patterns of connections between people such as such as network density, connectivity, hierarchy and so on),
2. the relational dimension (beliefs and norms that bond people together in a social network such as respect, friendship, trust, trustworthiness, expectations, norms, obligations)
3. the cognitive dimension (shared representation, interpretation and systems of meaning among people in the same social network, such as shared narratives, shared language and shared codes).
We adopt a longitudinal case as our research method. Drawing on findings from a microfinance programme on continuously improving health-related activities performed by Dhulikhel Hospital in Nepal over the period of 10 years, this research will be the first study to take the evolution of social business models over time into consideration. Dhulikhel Hospital’s Microfinance Program (MFP) introduced in 2008 as part of their community development programme, is considered a social business model innovation in the management literature. The Dhulikhel programme provides integrated microfinance with health components (such as microcredit and health education) to women in a novel way to enhance health as well as build livelihoods. We conducted 15 interviews with the people who developed and run the microfinance programme in Dhulikhel Hospital as well as the participants of the programme within two health centres (Figure 2).
We used several methods to analyse the data, which enabled us to examine data from several perspectives to explore interesting features and to cross-validate common findings. Firstly, the first author constructed a case narrative, including verbatim quotations from interviewees, to provide a rich description of the Business Model Innovation in relations to social capital development. In a similar approach to Jarzabkowski and Balogun (2009) this narrative was then read, discussed and refined by the other two researchers acting as ‘outsiders’ in questioning the narrative themes and timeline. Secondly, we constructed a time-ordered event listing (Miles and Huberman, 1994) to capture the temporal flow of the sequence of events, allowing us to identify the emergence and concurrency of different forms knowledge during the evaluation how the model works. Our in-depth case involved considerable iteration between data collection and analysis as we sought to ensure information was verified and meaningfully interpreted.
Findings:
The social business model evolved from microfinance with health education for disadvantaged women to integrating microfinance with other health components (i.e., health micro-insurance, linkage to health providers) to all family members of the participating women (se Figure 1).
Figure 1.
The business model aims seemed to be shifted away from how to give health education to women in order to solve their health problems to how programme can be part of the solution to these problems in the community via giving the participants the opportunity to ‘co-create’ new ideas/ services rather than remain passive microfinance participant.
We found that three social capital elements were essential to enabling social business model evolution. Please see Table 1.","Amit, R. and Zott, C.

"ADAMS, KAI-UWE","KOLLER, HANS",,,,,,OPEN INNOVATION: POTENTIAL OF ONLINE COMMUNITIES TO GENERATE PRODUCT INNOVATIONS – THE EXAMPLE OF SONY ALPHA CAMERAS,15 - Open Innovation,"The producer model is understood as the manufacturer's task of creating the key designs for innovation and selling them to the consumer through goods and services (Baldwin, Hippel, 2011). On the other hand, the Open and User Innovation (OUI) Research claims that the active involvement of users knowledge is a valuable resource for innovations which leads to products and services that meet users requirements better (Chesbrough, 2003; Prahalad, Ramaswamy, 2004; Sawhney, Verona, Prandelli, 2005; Vandenbosch/Dawar 2002). This work aims at extending this OUI paradigm by another example showing that users from photography elaborated almost all shortcomings in the previous versions of the second Sony Alpha camera generation in different online communities. Interestingly, it can be shown that Sony improved almost every shortcoming mentioned by the users with the next version of the camera.
Brief literature mapping and key references Research about open and user innovation (OUI) has shown that experienced and skilled users are united in online-communities and can contribute to product development (e.g., Füller et al., 2004; Füller et al., 2007; Janzik, Raasch, 2011). Online-Communities are individually structured (Stanoevska-Slabeva, 2002), they own the potential to influence the design- and communication costs positively (Baldwin, Hippel, 2011). The passive usage of online-communities by the producer allows a strong appropriation strategy without the risk of breaking the flow of information (Laursen, Salter, 2013).
Research questions This study intends to substantiate the potential of generating product innovations through the integration of user knowledge from online communities for another interesting example.
Method and Data This study follows a netnographic approach (Kozinets, 2002, 2006). Three selected online-communities are used to extract 7460 contributions by the community-members. Those contributions created a list of 40 improvement proposals, generated out of the discussions by the community members. These free-of-charge informations are available with no assistance of community members or operators needed.
Findings Online-communities offer a cost-effective and high-quality user involvement. The generated list of improvement proposals was significantly matched by the real world product improvement brought through the next product generation by the producer of the focal product. Second, community members appreciate that the information they contribute is captured and implemented. They see that the producer values their involvement which can have a positive impact on the image of the producer. As third potential, online communities can reduce communication costs of the producer, especially for producer innovation.
Members of online-communities take over explanations in the form of text contributions as well as extensive video tutorials.
Contribution to the field and managerial implications This study contributes to the literature about the usage of information that users from online-communities release freely to the producer and to other innovators. Against this backdrop companies need to integrate user communities into their innovation processes. Perhaps they even should foster and support this release of ideas. Second, managers should find a way to improve intraorganizational structures to match the gained user knowledge with the internal experts developing the next product or service (Foss, 2011). Third, to reduce the risk of an information overload or a delay a continuous analysis of online communities is better suited than the retrospective form of investigation used in this work. Fourth, communities can also be used to help with customer communication.","Baldwin, C., & Von Hippel, E. (2011).

"AL HASAN, RIMA","MICHELI, PIETRO",,,,,,CONFIGURATIONS FOR MANAGING THE INTERPLAY BETWEEN PROCESS IMPROVEMENT APPROACHES AND PRODUCT INNOVATION,"04 - Engineering, Production and Supply Issues in Innovation and Product Development","Organizations’ capacity to incrementally and radically innovate their products is crucial for their success, yet this constitutes a fundamental and enduring management challenge (Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009). Over the past decades, scholars in operations management, strategy and innovation management have proposed divergent conceptual arguments and drawn conflicting empirical conclusions in relation to the interplay between process improvement (PI) approaches and incremental and radical product innovation (Adler et al. 2009; Benner and Tushman, 2015). For some, PI can lead to both degrees of innovation; for others, PI inevitably hinders organizations’ capacity to innovate their products, particularly in a radical way (Benner and Tushman, 2002; Kim et al, 2012).
In-addition to the heterogeneity of the theoretical and empirical arguments that exist in the literature, little is known about the mechanisms that companies can use to manage the interplay between PI and incremental and radical product innovation. Therefore, this research examines how organizations manage the interplay between PI and incremental and radical product innovation.
Method
This research used a qualitative multiple case study approach. Four companies were purposefully sampled. All of the selected companies are large manufacturing companies and based in the United Kingdom. However, they operate in three different industries - automotive, aerospace and pharmaceutical - and vary in their implementation of PI approaches and in the degree of their product innovativeness. Over a 15-month period in 2016-2017, 44 semi-structured interviews with informants from different functional specialisms were conducted, and relevant documents collected. Data were analyzed through an iterative process by using NVivo software.
Findings and contributions
Four different configurations for managing the interplay between PI and product innovation emerged from the data - “strategic and holistic”, “facilitating and empowering”, “operational” and “project-based” - and their associated mechanisms were identified. Overall, PI approaches were considered as enablers for product innovation when used strategically; however, when following a “facilitating and empowering”, an “operational” or
a “project-based” configurations, PI was regarded as an indirect facilitator or as an irrelevant factor in relation to product innovation. Thus, the findings of this research move beyond a single view of PI (Benner and Tushman, 2015) and provide empirical evidence on the paradoxical use of PI to trigger different degrees of product innovation. In the full paper, these configurations and their associate mechanisms for managing the interplay between PI and product innovation will be discussed in more depth.","Adler, P.

"MICHELI, PIETRO",,,,,,,DESIGN THINKING FOR DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Design thinking is an emerging approach to innovation and problem-solving characterised by
a clear focus on users, the adoption of a systemic perspective, the application of the logic of
‘what may be’ rather than ‘what is’, cross-functional collaboration, iteration and
experimentation (Brown, 2008; Liedtka, 2015; Martin, 2009; Seidel and Fixson, 2013).
Despite increasing interest in industry, empirical research on this topic is still scant,
particularly in relation to its applicability and effectiveness (Micheli et al., 2018).
In this study we focus on large private companies intent in introducing design
thinking practices to support digital transformations aimed at establishing significantly new,
IT-enabled products and services and, eventually, at changing their overall business models
(Sebastian et al., 2017). We conducted this research in two stages: first, we undertook
interviews with 30 key informants working in different organizations, including technology
firms, design consultancies and research institutes to map current practices and identify
suitable sites for our in-depth investigation. Second, we carried out a total of 85 interviews in
nine very large, established companies (between 5 and 15 per site representing a range of
functional groups) operating in different industries: two financial services firms, two airlines,
two medical device manufacturers, a pharmaceutical firm, an appliance manufacturer, and a
software company.
Findings demonstrate the benefits of adopting design thinking practices and of
investing in digital technology in relation to both financial results and customer satisfaction.
Specifically, design thinking practices enabled the sampled organisations enact the shift from
a predominantly technology-push approach to one that starts and ends with the users in mind.
Examples include new ways of interacting with customers in retail banking (from “looking
after your money” to “helping you manage your finances”), airlines (from “flying from a to
b” to “providing travel experiences”) and in the appliance industry (from “selling devices” to
“shaping a better living”). Design thinking practices also enhanced employees’ job
satisfaction, as several firms increasingly connected internal management practices to service
and product delivery. Also, the adoption of digital technologies (e.g., apps, voice controls,
“Internet of Things”) enabled to enhance both users’ and employees’ experiences, as product
and services became more personalised and employees were better able to interact with users
and to suggest improvements. At the same time, this research points to the difficulties in
translating principles into practices and diffusing these across the firm, and to the changes in
structures, spaces and narratives that are necessary to promote and consolidate change
(Nambisan et al., 2017; Yoo et al., 2012).
This research has theoretical and practical implications in two main areas. First, it
shows how design thinking is conceived and implemented in organisations. In particular,
when compared to what written in both academic journals and business reports, the practice
of design thinking in the sampled organizations appears to emphasize certain aspects (e.g.,
user-centredness, cross-functional collaboration, iteration and experimentation) and to
downplay others (e.g., attention to problem framing, adoption of abductive reasoning).
Second, in relation to the introduction and uses of digital technology, this research identifies
three types of approaches - digitization, digital innovation, and digital transformation – each
one with different scope, advantages and drawbacks.","Brown, T. 2008. Design thinking. Harvard Business Review 86 (6): 84–92.","Luo, L., Kannan, P. ., & Ratchford, B. T. (2008).

"MICHELI, PIETRO","ROPER, STEPHEN","TURNER, JOANNE",,,,,"EXPLORING THE LINKS BETWEEN DESIGN INVESTMENT, INNOVATION AND PRODUCTIVITY",02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Empirical studies show that design is a primary driver of innovation in both manufacturing and services (Luchs, Swan, and Creusen, 2016) and that several firms are increasingly investing in design (Micheli, Perks and Beverland, 2018). However, there is no conclusive evidence of design’s impact, particularly in relation to organisational productivity.
In this study, we undertake a causal analysis of the links between design, innovation and productivity, drawing on data from around 15,000 UK companies which responded to two consecutive waves of the UK Innovation Survey. The starting point for our analysis is the UK Innovation Survey indicator of whether or not each firm “engages in design activities, including strategic, for the development or implementation of new or improved goods, services and processes.” Specifically, we examine whether firms which are engaging with design are more likely to innovate their products/services, processes, and organisational strategies and structures. Moreover, we explore the extent to which each of these types of innovation results in improvements in firms’ productivity.
We adopt a value chain perspective suggesting that design may influence innovation in the short-term, but that any productivity benefits may take some time to emerge. Our estimation approach comprises two elements. First, we use a series of probit models to model the impact of design engagement on the probability of innovation. Models are based on pooled data from waves 4-9 of the UK innovation survey and use all available observations. All models include wave and sectoral dummy variables. The second stage of our estimation approach links the innovation probit models with a simple productivity equation. Innovation variables (and the determinants) are lagged to reflect the time taken for innovation to influence productivity. The inclusion of the lagged productivity measure and the lagged innovation and design measures reduces the number of observations available.
Our findings show a consistently positive and significant causal effect of design engagement on the probability of product/service and process innovation. This effect is largest among manufacturing firms and where firms are also undertaking in-house R&D. Process and organisational innovation have positive and significant causal effects on productivity. Indeed, organisational innovation has a positive and significant effect for all firms, SMEs, R&D performers and non-performers, and non-manufacturing firms. Similarly, process innovation has a positive effect for all firm, non-R&D performers and non-manufacturing firms. On the other hand, product/service innovation has a consistently negative effect when it is significant, perhaps suggesting a disruption effect when new innovative products are first introduced (see also Bourke and Roper, 2017).
This research has several implications for theory and practice. In particular, design engagement increases the probability that firms will undertake both product/service and process innovation, whereas the link with organisational innovation appears not significant. As process innovation is positively related to subsequent productivity, the effect of design engagement on process change leads to productivity increases. Finally, the design effect through product/service innovation is sufficient to offset the negative effect, at least in the short-term, of product/service innovation on productivity.","Bourke, J., and Roper, S.

"CAYROL, ALEX","GILLIER, THOMAS","KOKSHAGINA, OLGA",,,,,THE INFLUENCE OF LEADERS’ EMOTIONS IN OPEN SCIENCE COMMUNITIES,15 - Open Innovation,"This research is based on the detailed empirical analysis of Polymath, an online collaborative initiative started by a group of mathematicians to solve extremely difficult problems (Ball 2014). In the online collaborative projects participation is voluntary, many contributors have not meet in person and there is no authoritative division of labour (O’Mahony & Ferraro, 2007). Online leaders play essential roles to foster motivation and engagement of participants in collective problem solving project (Johnson et al. 2015). Prior studies argue that there is still a limited understanding held by those running open collaborative initiatives projects on what type of leadership is required to solve complex problems online. This research studies how leaders’ emotion influence motivation and engagement of participants in open science communities. Although positivity is often recognized as important for creativity and innovation, little is known how positive emotion evolves within online interactions in collective problem solving (Harrison and Dossinger 2017, Lehmann-Willenbrock et al. 2017).
Based on the online data of four successful Polymath projects, this research uses a netnography research method and the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) to investigate the emotional content of the online messages exchanged between the leaders and the participants. Our research demonstrates that the language used by the leaders play an important role for maintaining participations. In particular, we observe that positive emotions are not always beneficial for solving extremely difficult problems. Instead, an ambivalent emotional state (Fong 2006) is essential for sustaining participants’ engagement online. Finally, we derive managerial implications regarding how leaders can set emotions in their communications online to effectively manage employees in innovative organizations.",Ball P (2014) Crowd-sourcing: Strength in numbers.

"AMANN, DANIEL ","KIHLANDER, INGRID","MAGNUSSON, MATS",,,,,DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION BARRIERS: EXPLORING VALUE NETWORK INERTIA IN COMPLEX LOW-VOLUME PRODUCTS,17 - Radical Innovation,"The market for complex products are often characterized by oligopolies with few but
very knowledgeable and demanding business or government customers. Moreover, many
sectors in these types of markets are often subject to a high degree of regulations (Davies
et al., 2011).
These specific characteristics for complex products have several implications for theories
on technological change (Hobday, 1998) implying among other things substantial inertia
(Walker, 2000). When disruptive changes occur, they are often first adopted in niche
markets by entrant companies addressing alternative customer values (Christensen,
2016). Reasons why incumbents lag behind are for example explained by lock-in effects
(Katz and Shapiro, 1994) and an exaggerated focus on the immediate demands of their
most profitable customers (Christensen, 2016). However, for complex products the
barriers for entrants to challenge the incumbents are for many reasons often huge (e.g.
Dombrowski and Gholz, 2006).
For studying value network inertia it certainly is interesting to address the early phases of
product development, since theses phases, according to e.g Khurana and Rosenthal
(1998), to a high degree determine a product’s success. Nevertheless, it appears to have
been limited attention paid to how alternative customer values are approached in the
development of complex product concepts.
2. OBJECTIVES AND RESEARCH QUESTIONS
Objective:
Our objective is to identify and explore specific enablers and barriers for disruptive
innovation in companies acting on oligopolistic markets as suppliers of complex lowvolume
products. This is done in order to better understand why necessary transitions are
delayed.
Research questions:
RQ1: Which are the specific characteristics that enable and disable disruptive innovation
for companies developing complex low-volume products on oligopolistic markets?
RQ2: How is concept development handled in these companies, and how do different
approaches to concept development influence the propensity to develop disruptive
innovations?
3. APPROACH/METHOD
Given the exploratory nature of the investigation, a case study approach of theoretically
sampled cases was found suitable. Four different companies, acting in different sectors
(energy, transportation, defence and healthcare) on oligopoly markets as suppliers of
complex low-volume products, were studied.
Empirical data consists of interviews with seventeen respondents representing different
functions in each case company. The analysis was guided by an analysis scheme derived
from theory on disruptive innovation. Single case analyses were followed by a
comparative cross-case analysis.
4. CONCLUSION AND CONTRIBUTION
Earlier findings in a single case study by Dedehayir et al. (2014), proposing an adopted
framework for disruptive innovations of complex products, is not supported in our study.
Moreover, our study indicates that new complex products might often include disruptive
technologies but that these products’ overall concepts rarely are considered disruptive.
There are a number of hampering factors, for example customers being locked-in by
expensive infrastructure and regulations. Since guidance of concept development rarely
encourages exploration of alternative costumer values, the traditional values, considered
as hygiene factors, are not challenged.
We contribute to the theory of disruptive innovation by explicating on the specific
characteristics of value network inertia for companies acting on oligopoly markets with
complex low-volume products. Insights based on studies of disruptive innovation from
the perspective of internal company processes are offered and specific challenges
concerning tournament goods and safety critical products are showed.
Our study contributes to practice by elaborating on managerial implications concerning
ways of working for proactively enabling disruptive complex product concepts.","Christensen, C., (2016), The innovators dilemma: When new technologies cause great firms to fail, Boston:

"FLORIAN, ANDRESEN","SCHULTE, BENJAMIN","KOLLER, HANS",,,,,SENSING THROUGHOUT THE ORGANIZATION: PROCESS-ORIENTED STRATEGIC FORESIGHT AS A MICRO-FOUNDATION OF DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES,20 - Theory Development in Innovation Research,"Contemporary organizations are more than ever under pressure to identify weak signals regarding changing markets or emerging and often disruptive technologies or business models. One of the most prominent views addressing these challenges is the dynamic capability framework explaining how organizations sense, seize, and reconfigure to continuously adapt to changing requirements and thereby outperform competitors (Helfat et al., 2007; Schilke, Hu, & Helfat, 2018; Teece, 2007; Teece, Pisano, & Shuen, 1997).
However, while a great deal of research focusses on the resource creation, evolution, or recombination central to this view (Adner & Helfat, 2003; Ambrosini, Bowman, & Collier, 2009; Danneels, 2011; Helfat et al., 2007; Maritan, 2001), there seems to be a shortage in explaining the necessary precondition of identifying and interpreting external and internal signals (Dong, Garbuio, & Lovallo, 2016). Thus, scholars regularly argue that the integration of research on strategic foresight into the literature on dynamic capabilities would yield gains for both fields (Agarwal Renu & Selen, 2009; Bowman & Ambrosini, 2003; Day & Schoemaker, 2016; Gavetti, 2005).
Diving into this scholarly intersection, we are also taking up recent calls for the integration of process approaches considering experienced agents from all over the organization to explain organizational sensing and seizing (Nonaka, Hirose, & Takeda, 2016; Salvato, 2009; Salvato & Rerup, 2011; Salvato & Vassolo, 2017). Thus, our understanding of strategic foresight is not focused on methods or tools but follows a process-based understanding of how various agents identify and engage with environmental changes (Langley, 1999; Van De Ven & Huber, 1990).
Following these lines, we are proposing a process approach of strategic foresight based on overlapping and intersecting “radar-groups” (Jahn & Koller, 2018; Koller, 2008). These radar-groups represent networks of knowledgeable agents bonded by local task interaction, observing a specific section of the internal/ external environment. We suggest that foresight evolves along the different (interconnected) practices of the organization, where agents while engaging in practice locally make sense of environmental dynamics, resulting in emergent initiatives and plans on how to respond to threats or opportunities in the sense of dynamic capabilities. Thus, this process-oriented foresight approach represents a perspective on foresight, grounded in an understanding of the organization as a complex adaptive system (Anderson, 1999; Stacey, 1995). In this approach, foresight does not take place at insulated departments but instead emerges from the shop floor to the C-suite.
Such an approach provides several advantages over traditional explanations of organizational
sensing or the vast array of foresight methods. First, a widespread integration of experts from
the shop floor into foresight activities throughout the organization will very likely change the
mental models of all participating agents. Activities are then not only connected to task or
process necessities but interpreted in a wider context of possible future threats or opportunities.
Second, the constant discussions within and between different radar-groups increase the
legitimacy of strategic initiatives based on collective foresight, thus, reducing inertial forces.
Finally, we are arguing that this process approach can be considered as a foresight capacity
within the dynamic capability framework. This foresight capacity is the firm's ability to
legitimize, interconnect, and motivate different agents to participate in the organizational
foresight process.","Adner, R., & Helfat, C. E. (2003). Corporate effects and dynamic managerial capabilities.

"ARREOLA, MARIA FERNANDA","TERLIER, ADRIEN",,,,,,IS THE SHOEMAKER'S SON GOING BAREFOOT? HOW ARE CONSULTING FIRMS INNOVATING WITHIN?,18 - Service Innovation and New Service Development,"Consulting firms have a tradition of being solicited by companies to solve complex issues,
tackle governance problems or catalyze decision making. Invented more than 130 years ago,
consulting firms have had to evolve their approach, expertise and service offerings in order
to provide added-value solutions to firms. Their evolution responds to their purpose; to drive
performance and facilitate strategic-choices.
Consulting firms have as core business to bring, stimulate and implement innovation inside
the company of their clients (Lemus-Aguilar & Nucheral, 2015). Mandel showed that almost
50% of the consulting missions brought “significant improvement” and were “a good source
of generating innovation into businesses” (2009. p.g 3). This explains why most of the
studies on innovation and services have shown that Knowledge-Intensive Business Services
industry (which consulting firms are part of) tend to be at the leading-edge with regard to
innovation (Trigo & Vence, 2012).
This innovation is highly related to the standardization of approaches (or methodologies)
that consulting firms develop for tackling client issues (Wright et al, 2012). This means that
consulting firms often apply models that have worked at other firms, adapting them to new
organizations (Mandel, 2009). This process gives assurance to firms, since they know that
the model has worked elsewhere, and provide a standard of operation for consultants, who
can profit from previous experiences, to conduct new missions. As Tether and Tajar (2008)
highlight, consulting companies are sources of information for innovation activities and such
innovations are only novel to the firm (2009).
However, as much as we know about consulting firms and the innovation they propose to
other firms, there is very little information as to how consulting firms innovate within.
Research on innovation inside of consulting firms is very scarce (O’Cass et al. 2013) and very
`
3
few elements exist to understand the way in which such innovations emerge and are shared
amongst consultants. There are however, some indications of the role of consultants in
generating new ideas. Often, in order to be promoted at a partner level they must show their
ability to generate new business for the firm which involve the creation of new service
(practice) area. Anand et al. show for example, that the creation of a new practice area, is in
itself part of the innovation process of a consulting firm (2007). In this case the creation of a
new practice comes from the willingness of one consultant to move forward in its carrier
(track) and for doing it he needs to show his self-motivation. This relates to Fischer’s finding
that innovation in consulting firms is highly dependent on the individual and entrepreneurial
behaviors of consultants (2011).
However, other than these appreciations, there is little that we know about the processes
and characteristics of innovation within consulting firms. Therefore, this research is
concerned with how innovation is generated and the processes that allow for its emergence
within consulting firms. Our research will consist of an exploratory qualitative analysis of one
of the leading consulting firms in the world. Though more than 10 interviews, with people
handling a diversity of roles within a leading consulting firm, we expect to deconstruct the
way in which innovation is perceived, encouraged and constructed. Our research will allow
us to determine the practices and mechanisms that allow for innovation inside of a
consulting practice and also the way in which such innovation interacts with the external
environment of the firm.
We expect to contribute to literature, by pointing to the sources of innovation within the
consulting firms, the profiles of innovators or facilitators of innovation, the practices that
encourage such innovation, its characteristics and finally how an innovation capability is held
and promoted in consulting environments.","Anand, N., Gardner, H. K., & Morris, T. (2007). Knowledge-based innovation:

"ARTUSI, FEDERICO ","BELLINI, EMILIO",,,,,,EMBODYING A NEW MEANING IN A SERVICE ORGANIZATION: FROM AN INNOVATIVE VISION TO DAILY PRACTICES,18 - Service Innovation and New Service Development,"Conceiving a new meaning for products and services is an effective way to gain a sustainable
competitve advantage (Verganti, 2009; 2016; Pinto et al., 2017). However, the process is not
straightforward and easy to implement (Verganti, 2016; Goto, 2017; Kembaren et al., 2014). In
particular, the extremely vague nature of meanings makes them subject to reinterpretations and
potential downgrade of the final solution (Kurzman, 2008). This is especially critical in services,
which, given their intangibility and subjectivity in the human touchpoints, insert a further layer of
complexity in maintaining meaning integrity from the vision to the delivered solution. As advocated
by many authors, the service experience cannot be directly controlled, leaving some room to cocreation
mechanisms between service provider and customers (Vargo, Lusch, 2006)).
While the communication of the new meaning at a strategic level has been addressed involving
narratives and metaphors (Dell’Era et al., 2008), the same cannot be said for the alignment toward
the new practices at an operative level. This research directly aims at filling the gap, by
understanding how a meaning innovator is able to align the whole personnel at the new envisioned
meaning. The empirical setting we selected in the retail service, given its highly interactive nature
and the high importance of customer experiences, which depend on specific cues and customers
(Verhoef et al., 2009). A single in-depth case study has been selected as the most appropriate
methodology. Although its being qualitative and subject to interpretation (Yin, 2013), it allows to
deeply dig into a social system, as a service organization, and to grasp all the details that allow such
an innovation to be implemented. To minimize bias, 15 people from the company have been
interviewed, through a semi-structured approach, and belonging to all the organizational levels. The
interviews have been conducted and independently coded by 3 researchers.
To analyze findings, the Normalization Process Theory (NPT, May, Finch, 2009) has been used,
highlighting the steps (often recursive) that bring from the new meaning to the new daily practices
adopted by front-line employees. Preliminary confirm the relevance of 3 critical phases in the
embodying process:
- The cognitive participation in the construction of specific elements of the service that people agree
will be meaningful to customers.
- The relation and interaction that new practices have with the normal ones. New capabilities and
approach needed as well as the integration of new elements in the previous selling ceremony.
- The collective reflection about the appropriateness of the new practices and the effective use in all
the company’s retailers.
The study aims at contributing at the innovation literature, specifically regarding the radical
innovation of meaning framework (Verganti, 2009; 2016). Within this field, it opens the way
toward the study of implementation, keeping the focus on the human factor in a critical setting as
the retail service. From a practitioner point of view, it highlights the practices that allow the
effective translation of a new meaning into daily operations. In this way, it would help
organizations in effectively implementing it by focusing on crucial activities in the transformation
process.","Dell’era, C., Marchesi, A., Verganti, R., & Zurlo, F. (2008). Language mining: Analysis

"ARTUSI, FEDERICO ","BELLINI, EMILIO",,,,,,INSTANTIATING INNOVATION OF MEANING IN THE RETAIL EXPERIENCE: A MOMENT THAT MAKES THE DIFFERENCE,18 - Service Innovation and New Service Development,"Abstract
The Innovation of Meaning framework characterizes a specific process to obtain a radical
innovation, potentially able to set a new business standard (Verganti, 2016). Although described
with extensive details in the strategic generation of the new meaning, there is a lack of
understanding about how to transfer the new meaning to the new solution (Eling, Herstatt, 2017). In
particular, the approaches suggested for implementing the solution, coming from the design field,
are usually founded upon opposite principles (outside-in vs inside-out). In addition to that, meaning
are extremely vague and subject to individual interpretations, making it difficult to remain stable
across all the phases that lead to implementation. In this research, we study the practices that
intervene between the new meaning definition and operationalization of the innovation. The
concept generation phase during the broader front-end of innovation has been identified as critical
for maintaining alignment over the innovation. In fact, concept is a tool that can be managed from
different perspectives and it is able to drive alignment over the innovation and to help avoid service
failure (Beltagui et al., 2017). To investigate the topic, given the highly conceptual starting point, a
mixed method has been set (Tashakkori, Creswell, 2007). An experiment with 77 Italian retailers
has been designed to explore a possible new approach in the definition of the concept for radical
innovation of meaning. The choice to focus on the retail service industry is twofold. On the one
hand, retail is a fast changing industry, where multiple innovation approaches have been proposed
and traditional players are suffering to innovate. On the other hand, the intangible and
heterogeneous nature of services makes the meaning even more subject to individual
interpretations. The preliminary findings have been subsequently enriched with individual
interviews with a subset of participating managers, to minimize our interpretation and increase the
study robustness. Interviews were built on a semi-structured protocol (Cohen, Crabtree, 2006;
Harrel, Bradley, 2009), to allow managers to perfectly express the reasons why one method was
perceived as more effective than the other. Participants have been selected for being exceptional
cases. Findings indicate that the service concept needs to be simple and focusing on one specific
element (moment) in the customer journey. This “Moment of Meaning”, directly representing the
why people would choose to go in that specific retail space, allows for a better transferring of the
company vision from the strategic conceiving to the final solution, minimizing alternative
interpretations. Proceeding over a more simple interpretation before going to the customer journey
mapping (Bitner et al., 2008; Patricio et al., 2011) or service blueprinting (Teixeira et al, 2017;
Folstad, Kvale, 2018) allow teams to achieve a higher perceived effectiveness two critical areas:
- Alignment over the new meaning: identified as critical by Goldstein et al. (2002), for whom a key
feature of the service concept is that of granting organizational alignment. In particular, this is a
though issue in the case of radical innovation, where the activities are extremely uncertain and
dynamic (O’Connor, Rice, 2013; Van de Ven, 2008).
- Communication of the new meaning: the ability to correctly represent the new product or service
is in fact a key element for assuring a common understanding and sharing of it (Okhuysen, Bechky,
2009).
This research contributes to the literature by directly expanding the innovation of meaning
framework (Verganti, 2009; 2016) in a previously neglected area (Eling, Herstatt, 2017). In addition
to that, it is relevant to managers for it isn’t limited to a theoretical analysis of the issue, but it rather
provides a practical tool for concepting a radically new service.","Beltagui, A., Sigurdsson, K., Candi, M., & Riedel, J. C. K. H. (2017). Articulating the service

"AZABAGIC, NERMIN ","GEMSER, GERDA ","KARPEN, INGO",,,,,MAKING DESIGN VIABLE,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Design has become a critical element in creating compelling market products and services
that resonate with customers, consistently produce financial rewards, and build brand
loyalty (Rae, 2005). As suggested in a recent report by McKinsey Consulting, one of the
management areas in need of improvement is measuring and driving design performance
with the same rigour as organisations tend to measure other business functions (Sheppard
et al, 2018). Successful design involves desirability, feasibility and viability considerations
when designing new products and services (Brown, 2009; Johansson et al 2013). While
desirability addresses user demand, feasibility relates to required resources (e.g.
technology), and viability accounts for potential outcomes such as commercial benefits. In
this research, we will focus specifically on assessing viability in the context of design. Tools
and methods to assess viability when designing are scant in literature (Carlgren et al., 2014),
while such methods and tools are needed to show how design is tied to business goals. We
aim to develop a method to help organisations effectively assess viability when designing a
new product or service.
In the first phase of our research, we studied current practices (and shortcomings) related
to viability management through a benchmarking study with 20 leading global design
practitioners. These practitioners were selected based on being known in the market as
leading companies and/or designers in the strategic design field. The findings suggest that
the current viability practices are typically not well understood, codified, or managed,
indicating a clear need for improvement. Based on the findings of this first phase, we
developed a method to effectively assess and manage viability, consisting of the following
practices: setting business objectives, understanding business landscape, specialised
resource allocation, identification and testing of assumptions, creating or enabling of
‘intersects’, prototyping, measuring, and adjusting.
In the second phase of the research, we used design science to further develop and iterate
the method with 12 leading viability management practitioners. This phase is currently in
progress and results will be presented at the conference. Design science research is a wellestablished
methodology in the information technology field (Kuechler and Vaishnavi 2008;
Winter 2008) that is now spreading to service research (Beloglazov et al. 2015; Ostrom et al.
2015). It is a methodology for understanding organisational phenomena in context and
advances research by creating and evaluating artefacts (e.g., models and methods) that
solve organisational problems (Hevner et al. 2004).
In the third phase of the research, we will embed and validate the method in a real-world
case study with a large technology and consulting firm using action research. This phase is
envisioned to start early next year and results will be presented at the conference. Broadly
defined, action research involves ""researchers working with members of an organisation
over a matter which is of genuine concern to them and in which there is an intent by the
organisational members to take action based on the intervention"" (Eden & Huxham, 1996:
527). In design science research, design and the proof of its usefulness is the central
component, whereas in action research, the focus of interest is the organisational context
and the active search for problem solutions therein (Peffers et al, 2007). Therefore, both
methods are useful and complementary for addressing the research aim and indeed, there
are overlaps between the methods.
From a managerial contribution perspective, with our research we provide a method for
viability practices that will enable managers and designers to optimise the viability of
strategic design initiatives. From a theoretical perspective, we show how design science
research can be used as a structure to present action research, and likewise, the search for a
designed artefact could be presented as action research.","Beloglazov, A., Banerjee D., Hartman A., and Buyya R. (2015), ‘‘Improving

"BARBIER, RAPHAELLE ",,,,,,,REVISITING THE MANAGEMENT OF TECHNOLOGY-PUSH SITUATIONS: MODELING AND EXPERIMENTING METHODS TO DESIGN THE TECHNICAL IDENTITY OF A TECHNOLOGY,14 - New Trends and Ideas in Innovation,"In competitive industries, it has become vital for companies to innovate at an increasingly
rapid pace. In this context, the literature reports on specific situations, coined as
“technology-push”, where companies struggle to turn an already-developed technology into
successful innovations. This paper brings theoretical and practical insights on the
management of such situations, by introducing the notion of “technical identity”.
Brief literature mapping and key references
In the literature, methods for technology-push management focus on identifying industrial
contexts in which the new technology may be useful. These approaches first describe the
technology as a set of certain characteristics, which is then used to identify potential markets
through road-mapping (Caetano et Amaral 2011), technology-performance scenarios (Wall,
Gausemeier, et Peitz 2013), TRIZ-based methodology (Glaser et Miecznik 2009), patent
mapping (Lee, Yoon, et Park 2009), the involvement of lead-users (Henkel et Jung 2010),
interdisciplinary teams (Souder 1989) or experts (Heiss et Jankowsky 2001). All these
methods assume the existence of the pre-mentioned set which could be defined as an
understandable language used to describe the technology to the users. In this paper, we
propose to coin this language the “technical identity” of the technology.
Recent research shows that biases may occur when this technical identity is built. Cognitive
fixation effects (Agogué et al. 2014) can lead specialists to implicitly build a “presumed
identity” drawing from the industrial contexts they assess as promising (Gillier et Piat 2011).
Evolutionary approaches, recognizing the difficulty of identifying the right technical identity,
expect it to progressively emerge from the confrontation with different would-be users.
Although allowing the company to avoid its own fixation effects, this learning process and
the identification of would-be users can be time-consuming and complex (Thomke, von
Hippel, et Franke 1998; Loch, Terwiesch, et Thomke 2001; Sommer et Loch 2004).
Research question
Specific efforts are thus needed to overcome fixation effects and build an efficient learning
strategy in technology-push situations. To do so, we take the “technical identity” as a design
object. The literature recognizes that the identity of a technical object is shaped during
innovative processes (Faulkner et Runde 2009; Gillier et Piat 2011) however failing to provide
methods to manage this process. Therefore this paper addresses the following research
question: what are the methods that could lead to efficiently design a “defixating technical
identity”?
Approach and method
Our methodology follows a two-fold modelling logic. First, we rely on design theory
(Hatchuel et Weil 2003) to model one’s reasoning when one designs a “technical identity”.
This enables us to identify three different strategies and the learning process induced in each
case. Second, methodologies were tested for each learning strategy. To do so, a case study
was conducted in an engineering research and development SME designing electromagnetic
systems for the automotive sector. This company was dealing with a technology-push
situation - a flexible magnetic material discovered during in-house research project - and had
long been unsuccessfully studying this technology. We validated the relevance of this
empirical setting for our research question by proving that specialists were initially fixed on a
technical identity.
Main findings, managerial implications and contribution to the field
Our study offers a fresh look on technology-push situations. Besides the common strategy of
screening the potential issues that the technology could solve, two complementary
strategies are identified. First, direct substitution of the new technology for an existing one
should not be neglected as it allows crucial learning even if it does not provide new industrial
contexts. Second, looking for applications without identifying would-be users should also be
considered, by designing technical identities that are generic and stimulating enough to
reach unexpected users and drag them to develop applications of their own.
These strategies being complementary, we propose insights on managerial implications to
articulate them in organizational settings. Consequently, we provide practitioners and
scholars with new perspectives on how emerging technologies and technology-push
situations could be managed.","Agogué, Marine, Akin Kazakçi, Armand Hatchuel, Pascal Le Masson, Benoit Weil, Nicolas

"BEHRENS, JUDITH ","RÖHM, CHRISTIAN",,,,,,HOW DOES FAMILY INVOLVEMENT IN TOP MANAGEMENT TEAMS IMPACT EXPLORATION AND EXPLOITATION? THE ROLE OF FAULTLINES AND NON-ECONOMIC GOALS,17 - Radical Innovation,"We draw on an upper echelon perspective (Carpenter et al., 2004; Hambrick & Mason,
1984) and behavioral agency theory to argue that the characteristics of the family CEO play a
particularly relevant moderating role because of his or her formal power as head of the TMT
as well as their affiliation with the owning family (Kraiczy, Hack, & Kellermanns, 2015b;
Minichilli et al., 2010). Specifically, CEOs' family-centered noneconomic (FCNE) goals
pertain to the family's ""values, attitudes and intentions"" (Chrisman et al., 2012, p. 268) and are
pervasive drivers of firm behavior, strategy and performance (Chrisman et al. (2014b). As our
theory development will show, the way how family TMT involvement and CEOs’ FCNE
goals conjointly impact exploration and exploitation appears to be complex and yields a
number of new insight that considerably advance current understanding of the role of family
TMTs in firms’ exploration and exploitation activities.
Method
To test our hypotheses, we collected data from German family firms. We used the
Amadeus database, listing all corporate organizations in Germany, as the basis and applied
three criteria to create our sample. A total of 118 firms agreed to participate upon contact,
representing a response rate of 12.4%. We ran OLS regressions using multiplicative, additive,
and subtractive ambidexterity as dependent variables.
Results
Initial empirical studies find mostly positive connections between family firm status
and exploration and exploitation (e.g., Lubatkin, 2006; Stubner et al., 2012). However,
conceptual work came to more complex and ambiguous conclusions (e.g., Hiebl et al., 2015).
This study is among the first to take a detailed look at family components as well as family
essence to investigate exploration and exploitation in family firms and finds empirical
evidence that family TMT involvement and family CEOs' goals and motivations present
central antecedents of exploration and exploitation.
Results on the inverse U-shaped relationship between family TMT involvement and
exploration at lower levels of family CEOs' goals and motivations offer another interesting
vantage point regarding faultlines. Faultlines can lead to increased conflict, and decreased
team cohesion and have thus generally been connected with negative effects on TMT
dynamics and alignment (Li & Hambrick, 2005; Ndofor et al., 2015; Thatcher & Patel, 2011;
Thatcher & Patel, 2012; Tuggle et al., 2010). Yet, Thatcher and Patel (2012) suggest that
moderate faultlines might also have positive effects. Under this assumption, latent faultlines
between family and nonfamily TMT members would be reduced to a moderate level when
they are not reinforced by divisive goals and motivations. Moderate subgroups in TMTs can
lead to productive moderate levels of conflict (Simons & Peterson, 2000), higher levels of
overall creativity (Bezrukova & Uparna, 2009), and increased group learning (Gibson &
Vermeulen, 2003) which are important antecedents of exploration (Lavie et al., 2010). Hence,
our findings regarding an inverse U-shape could also be evidence of the potential positive
effects of moderate faultlines (Li & Lau, 2014).",,"Brettel, M., F. Heinemann, A. Engelen, and S. Neubauer. 2011.

"BELKHOUJA, SENDA ","GENET, CORINE","MANGEMATIN, VINCENT",,,,,HOW ENGINEERS INFLUENCE DECISION MAKERS DURING THE FUZZY-FRONT END NPD PHASE?,"04 - Engineering, Production and Supply Issues in Innovation and Product Development","In established companies, several projects of innovations are proposed by R&D managers and their teams composed of scientists and engineers. More particularly, during the fuzzy front end NPD phase, where the innovation is not enough determined, Top managers need to be convinced in order to decide whether they accept to invest and to keep alive one idea of innovation or not (Eling, Griffin, & Langerak, 2014, 2016; Ocasio, 1997). As in large companies an important number of projects can exist simultaneously, R&D managers who suggest the different projects need to attract the attention of top managers (Dutton et al 2001; Maula, Keil, & Zahra, 2013). To do so, -as studied in issue selling literature- R&D managers use several ways and strategies to create internal visibility around their innovation and show the value of their innovative projects (Dutton and Ashford, 1993; Dutton, Ashford, & Lawrence, 2001; Howard-Grenville, 2007). Traditionally, as described by Ocasio in attention based view theory- middle managers, implement internal factors to convince top managers (for example: feasibility of the innovation, costs of manufacturing) (Ocasio, 1997). Nevertheless, in this paper. We focus on the fuzzy front end NPD stage (Eling et al., 2014, 2016; Eling & Herstatt, 2017a). And we seek to show that when middle managers do not achieve their goal of selling their innovation to top managers, middle managers go toward external actors. Hence, we focus in this paper on the integration of professional end-users, as a particular mechanism adopted by R&D managers in their innovation in order to gain the attention of top managers and get their project developed in priority (Khanagha, Volberda, & Oshri, 2017). In fact, Katila et al (2017) show that -in young firms of medical devices- professional end users, can have different roles and they are more innovative in technical and governance roles than in executive roles (Katila, Thatchenkery, Christensen, & Zenios, 2017). While recent literature suggests that professional end-users influence the form in which decision-making is taken within the firm, by the nature of their empirical data and analysis, they cannot say much about how professional end-users
influence the attention and curiosity of top managers within the firm. Hence in this study, we address the following research question: How engineers influence decision makers during the fuzzy-front end NPD phase? To examine empirically this question, we conduct a single case study which relies on one project aimed at new product development within one biotech company specialized in in-vitro diagnosis. Data on this case are collected through interviews with different internal and external players such as middle managers (R&D managers, Project managers, and Marketing managers), top managers and professional end users. We also collected secondary data such as technical documents (eg: project documents, marketing study, users reports), meeting reports, documents of internal communication, and filed notes. Findings show that for innovation projects, when there is a tension in the communication between top managers, and middle managers who are R&D managers and marketing managers; R&D managers become in lack of informations about the market. Hence, R&D managers, need to include in their project professional end users for a main reason: to capture the attention of top managers and convince them to accept to develop their innovation, at the beginning of the innovation project.
Our paper contributes to the attention based view theory (Khanagha et al., 2017; Ocasio, 1997; Ocasio & Mauskapf, 2016 ): On one hand, by detailing that the middle management in dealing with different groups of middle managers such as R&D manager and Marketing managers, especially that is related to innovation which requires the interaction of different groups. On the other hand, we focus on external players such as professional end-users, who are integrated by R&D managers to sell their project and attract the attention of top managers. Moreover, our paper contributes to the lead user’s theory, by highlighting the role of creating visibility and value that professional end users can provide to innovation in order to convince
top managers to allocate their attention. It also impacts the criteria of identification of the right professional end-users by the company.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"BELLIS, PAOLA ","BUGANZA, TOMMASO","PRESS, JOSEPH ","TRABUCCHI, DANIEL ","VERGANTI, ROBERTO",,,LEADERSHIP AND DESIGN IN INNOVATION: FROM PROCESS TO PEOPLE-OBJECT INTERACTION,20 - Theory Development in Innovation Research,"Schumpeter`s (1934) fundamental definition of innovation is still very relevant today. By
focusing on the aim to implement something new, he highlights the concreteness of
innovation - it must become reality. Scholars of innovation have interpreted this position
from the perspective of process, i.e. the activities that needs to be done to make
innovation happen (Eling and Herstatt 2017; Luchs et al., 2016; Shane and Ulrich, 2004).
Among many others, Cooper (1990) proposes the widely diffused stage-and-gate model,
emphasizing the sequencing of activities to foster innovation effectively and efficiently.
Inspired by Simon (1969), Clark and Fujimoto (1991) propose innovation as a problemsolving
process, which elaborates information. Later, even agile and iterative models
described innovation as the result of a (more flexible) process (MacCormack et al., 2001).
More recently, Design Thinking has suggested new process perspectives, such us the
double diamond approach to diverge and converge (Brown, 2009). Knapp and colleagues
(2016) suggest a set of defined activities to make innovation viable in only five days, and
Ries (2011) defines the steps to continually innovate business models.
These models have different goals (from product to organization innovation) and
different origins (from entrepreneurship to design), but they share something: they
propose a process to realize innovation. However, today the processes that help managers
to find a new innovative idea may not be sufficient anymore (Burkus, 2013; Stam et al.,
2013; Verganti, 2017). First, innovation is moving away from R&D and diffusing into
organizations and networks. It moves away from professionals and it is with everyone.
This implies that innovation is “voluntary” (Hill et al. 2014) and happens only if people
are engaged to make innovation happen. Second, we live in a world that is overcrowded
by ideas. This shifts the attention from creating new ideas to finding a meaningful
direction (Verganti, 2017). Innovation, in this scenario, is less a result of a process, but of
the collective sense-making around the direction and what it represents to stakeholders
(Stigliani and Ravasi, 2012).
As these new perspectives emerge, scholars and practitioners are starting to go beyond
processes and focus on our inherent human sense of purpose. Indeed, innovation can be
about people (Ovan, 2015), it may overcome technological opportunities and require for
people that are ready to act (Mehregany, 2013) and be engaged to think together (de Anca
and Aragon, 2016).
This study aims to propose a conceptual framework that offers a different perspective on
innovation. It has been conceived bringing together different streams of literature that
look at how innovation happens: i) Innovation as a search for meaning; ii) Design as
engaging activity and, iii) Leadership as a community builder. We contend that i) when
people innovate, they are motivated by a sense of purpose and look for things that are
meaningful, they may go beyond the product and focus on its intrinsic meaning
(Verganti, 2016; Wenger, 1991; Frankl, 1985). Since the act of making and negotiating
meaning is a uniquely human experience (Wenger, 1991), it is essential to engage people
towards achieving a convergence of meaning. As people continuously pass through
divergent and convergent phases of reflection, they engage in a form of collective sensemaking,
(Berger and Luckman, 1966; Bruner, 2009; Goodman, 1978). ii) The activities
of co-creating – the discipline of design – can bring a crucial contribution about shared
meanings by engaging people around a shared innovative direction (Munari, 1981; Kelley
and Kelley, 2012; Schon, 1995; Pendleton-Jullian and Brown 2016). iii) Such a collective
and shared act, where innovators co-create in a shared space (Carson et al., 2007; Hoch,
2013; Hill et al., 2014), underlies an innovative definition of Leadership – meaning
making in a community of practice (Drath and Palus, 1994).
Our perspectives are informed by the Actor-Network Theory, a socio-philosophical
approach that attempts to understand complex social situations by focusing attention on
relational elements, referred to as associations (Latour, 2005). It builds on the observation
that the world is formed by heterogeneous actors and networks and claims that these
objects cannot be studied independently and outside of their context. Underpinning the
theory is the concept of co-construction (Latour, 1987, 1996; Callon, 1991), according to
which the elements taking part in the process are re-shaped and linked together. Similarly
reinforced by the sense-making theory (Berger and Luckman, 1966; Bruner, 2009;
Goodman, 1978), we propose that innovation may be studied as a collective act towards
finding a common direction, which evolves and changes through a collective and coconstructive
approach of all the actors (the innovators) involved in making innovation
happen. Circumscribing collective meaning making, the actors themselves are those who
bring their epistemic worlds - values, their purpose, mindset, knowledge and even
identity - into the shared space where the innovation is taking place (Coopey et al. 1997;
Weick, et al. 2005; Weick, 1995). In this designerly experience, stakeholders “make” and
“frame” objects that represent their worlds (Cross 2002, Stigliani and Ravasi 2012). In
our view, the act of innovating takes place in a “shared” space where people meet and
interact with the common purpose to design new meanings. Indeed, these interactions
enable the co-creation of common representations which are essential for the collective
creation of a shared new meaning, hence innovation.
Such reflections encourage us to rethink the traditional tenets of innovation, i) from a
process to social interactions; ii) from thinking to making; iii) from ideas to objects; iv)
from tools to shared spaces; v) from creativity to critique; vi) from leader to leadership.
Such epistemic and ontological shifts, reinforcing meaning at the center of innovation,
may reframe the innovation experience to reveal the catalysts of individual,
organizational, and societal transformation. We aim to let emerge a research agenda that
may propose these and other future avenues in the innovation research.","Berger, P. L., & Luckmann, T. (1966). The social construction of reality. New York.","Autio, E., & Thomas, L. (2014). Innovation ecosystems: Implication for Innovation

"BELLIS, PAOLA ","VERGANTI, ROBERTO",,,,,,PAIRS AS PIVOTS OF INNOVATION: HOW COLLECTIVE SENSE MAKING BENEFITS FROM INNOVATING IN TWO,07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"Studies have shown that team working presents significant advantages in innovation
(Wiita and Leonard, 2017, Hammedi, et. al 2011, Stam, et al. 2013), however it also
presents limits when it comes to converge into an innovative direction: conflicts and
bandwagon effects cause a progressive watering down of innovation in search of an
average solution (Stam, et al. 2013).
Thus, the purpose of this paper is to investigate if the pair can be a good intermediate
step towards the development of shared, innovative and meaningful directions.
Indeed, scholars already enhanced not only how team’s outputs and coordination
benefit from a gradual growth of the team itself, but also how dyads collaboration
could be the primary unit to reach the expected results (Weber, 2006; Charness and
Yang, 2014; Frey and Goldstone 2016; Verganti 2017).
Traditionally, corporations ask people to join directly into teams who are required to
both imagine ideas for where to go (a divergent phase of creation) and simultaneously
align towards a new shared direction (a convergent phase of creation). This interplay
between divergence and convergence is considered as a form of collective sensemaking,
in which the team hopefully converge into an innovative shared direction
(Berger and Luckman, 1966; Bruner, 2009; Goodman, 1978).
This shared meaningfulness is essential for project success: team performances are
positively related to the level of agreement of the entire team on the direction to
follow (McComb et al. 1999). However, the tension between divergence and
convergence causes notable challenges: the latter often implies conflicts,
compromises, and bandwagon effects, that undermine its meaningfulness for the
individual team member. The innovativeness of the direction is therefore attenuated
and/or people feel hardly engaged to move forward (Verganti, 2017; Van de Ven 1986;
Tuckman 1965).
Recently, scholars have performed numerous studies aimed at understanding how
teams can overcome the strains and bandwagon effects that limit teams in innovation
(Guo, et al. 2017, Andriopoulos, et al. 2018; Colombo, et al. 2017; O’Connor and Veryzer.
2001; Reid and de Brentani 2004; de Bertani, and Reid, 2012). Most of these studies
consider teams as such, and propose guidelines to innovate better as a team. We want
to take a step back, and look at the problem from a different perspective: what
happens when people do not gather in teams directly, but pass through a more gradual
process of collaboration and convergence (Weber, 2006; Charness and Yang, 2014;
Frey and Goldstone 2016)? In particular, what happens when people, before joining in
larger teams, take a preliminary step by first working in pairs?
As a matter of fact, some of the most significant innovations of the past years have
been developed by pairs of individuals. Jobs and Wozniak invented the personal
computer, Page and Brin invented Google and Oppenheimer and Groves developed
the first atomic bomb (Hunter, et al. 2012; Isaacson 2011).
Therefore, in such a context, we investigate how a more progressive growth, in which
people pass through pair work and only later engage in larger teams, can be an
effective way to deal with tensions between divergence and convergence when
innovating.
In particular, we investigate if the pair can be the pivot in the collective sense making
process of a team aimed to converge into a shared and innovative direction.
Indeed, we propose that the intimate and protected environment provided by the pair
not only facilitates the convergence process, but also increases the probability for an
individual to bring out its own vision and to make it more robust thanks to the support
of his or her partner (Hunter, et al. 2012; Hunter et al. 2017; Shenk 2014; Farrel 2003;
Verganti 2017).
To test our hypothesis, we performed a laboratory experiment, with the support of a
control group, by involving a group of 130 students who were asked to address a brief
provided by a company aimed to find an innovative direction.
Results show how the meaningfulness of the vision developed by those teams that
passed through a pair session (treated group) is significantly higher than those that
worked directly in team (control group).
We discuss the results of the empirical evaluation and the main implications of our
findings for theory and practice. Finally, we","Andriopoulos, C., Gotsi, M., Lewis, M. W., & Ingram, A. E. (2018). Turning the sword:

"TRABUCCHI, DANIEL ","MORETTO, ANTONELLA","BUGANZA, TOMMASO",,,,,DISRUPTING THE DISRUPTORS OR ENHANCING THEM? HOW THE BLOCKCHAIN MAY RE-SHAPE TWO-SIDED PLATFORMS,14 - New Trends and Ideas in Innovation,"The relative weight of platform-based businesses is growing continuously and becoming more and more
relevant (e.g., Choudary et al., 2016; Evans and Schmalansee, 2016). Unicorns like Uber and Airbnb, along
with their multi-billion market value, are often used as key examples for this paradigm.
These companies aim to link two different groups of customers, which may be hosts and guests, drivers and
passengers. In the literature, this kind of businesses has been defined as two-sided platforms (e.g., Rochet and
Tirole, 2003; Hagiu and Tirole, 2015). Businesses characterized by three necessary conditions: i) the existence
of two (or more) groups of customers, ii) linked through indirect network externalities (Katz and Shapiro,
1985) and iii) with a platform provider able to internalize (at least partially) the externalities (Evans, 2003).
Beside being based on very traditional mechanism (similar to the one of traditional newspapers or of the
credit cards), in the last decade, this kind of businesses model was revamped and became more and more
popular. The spreading of digital technologies enabled companies to act as orchestrators of external resources
(Sun and Tse, 2009; Amit and Zott, 2015) bringing management research to focus on the key peculiarities of
this business model (McIntyre and Srinivasan, 2017).
These businesses have peculiarities in their early phases, needing both sides on board to make the platform
viable (Caillaud and Julien, 2003). Their value proposition needs to consider two different kinds of customers
simultaneously (Muzellec et al., 2015). At the same time, these businesses offer interesting value capturing
opportunities based on the collected data (Trabucchi et al., 2017) and can scale at a very high pace (Libert et
al., 2016).
At the basis of a two-sided platform there is a platform provider that enables a transaction between two
sides, aiming to reduce the transaction costs between the two parties (Evans and Schmalansee, 2016).
Interestingly, in the last years a new technology emerged that may challenge some of the underlying
assumptions of these model: the blockchain. It enables the creation of a peer-to-peer network able to
authenticate transactions, upon which applications and services may be built, enabling peers to have
transactions without the need of a central platform (Miau and Yang, 2018).
The blockchain technology may change the traditional role of the platform provider in two-sided platforms,
having a decentralized network that may be in charge of some of its activities, such as assuring the transaction
between the two sides, connecting the sides and so on. Therefore, this research aims to explore how the
blockchain technology can re-shape two-sided platforms, focusing in particular on the role of the platform
provider.
This exploratory research is based on a multiple case study (Yin, 2013) taking an inductive approach to
explore this emerging phenomenon. Ten marketplaces based on the blockchain technology have been selected.
All of them are based on the Etheruem network, which is considered one of the most influential open
blockchain (Wood, 2014; Miau and Yang, 2018). Data gathering is based both on primary and secondary
sources. The white papers used for the ICO (the Initial Coin Offering, through which the marketplace on a
blockchain have birth) have been analyzed to prepare the interviews and to compare the operational
characteristics of the different cases. For each marketplace, one or more member/s of the core team have been
interviewed, using a semi-structured protocol. The interviews aim to understand why they decided to create
their businesses on the blockchain technology – instead of through traditional digital platforms – and to explore
their role as matchmakers between buyers and sellers. All the interviews have transcribed and coded (Saldaña,
2015; Corbin and Strauss, 2008).
Preliminary results of this research show a significant shift in the role of the central platform that links the
two sides. We may frame this as a shift from a ""platform provider"" to a ""service provider"" that links the two
groups of customers since the underlying architecture already exists.
From an academic perspective, this research digs in the peculiarities of this model, unveiling new dynamics
in these businesses. Indeed, it seems that different variables may be considered to classify two-sided platforms
(such as the degree of centralization of the platform provider), expanding previous characteristics (Tasucher
and Laudien, 2018). Furthermore, some of the essential characteristics of two-sided platforms may be enlarged.
Traditional theories define the role of cross-side network externalities (Katz and Shapiro, 1985). It seems that
tokens used in the system may play an enhancing role in creating different kinds of externalities and in fostering
participation on the two sides.
From a managerial perspective, this research offers a first understanding of the key differences between
traditional platforms and blockchain enabled businesses. On the one hand, this shift may reduce some of the
traditional challenges of two-sided platforms, such as the chicken-and-egg paradox (Caillaud and Julien, 2003;
Stummer et al., 2018) or the need to create trust between the two sides (Mazzella et al., 2016). On the other,
the network itself – which has been considered the most significant asset for two-sided platforms (Libert et al.,
2016) – is a shared asset among all the services based on the same open blockchain, bringing the levers of
competition to a more traditional setting. Furthermore, one of the most significant features of the blockchain
technology is the chance to enable trusted relationships between unknown parties, making privacy a rigorous
data access a key feature (e.g., Böhme et al., 2016). This characteristicmakese data-driven strategies that have
often been used in two-sided platforms to capture value something impossible (Trabucchi et al., 2017).","Amit, R., and C. Zott. 2015. Crafting business architecture: The antecedents of business model design.

"TRABUCCHI, DANIEL ","BUGANZA, TOMMASO",,,,,,"I DON’T LIKE IT, BUT I DON’T KNOW WHY EXPLORING COGNITIVE BIASES IN THE MOBILE APPS",02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Technologies and digital services have been shaping the way people live and perceive the reality since their
diffusion: time, physical and mental effort has gained different weights and values in customer's mind. We are
bombarded by hundreds of opportunities continuously (Schwartz, 2004), living in the access economy, where
in just a few taps on a digital screen we can receive all the services we want (Belk, 2014). We live in a fastpacing
world, where customer expectations increase continuously and where people can quickly shift from
one service to another one (Chua et al., 2017).
These dynamics are increasingly challenging the customer in assessing the value of new services because oz
competence destroying effects (Tushman and Anderson, 1986; Henderson 2006), cognitive workload (Sweller
and Chandler, 1991, Nielsen 2012) and paradox of choices (Schwartz, 2004)
In this environment, it is becoming more and more difficult for companies to gain customer attention,
especially for the ones who don't have the chance to radically innovate (Forhez and Evans, 2018).
Previous studies focus on how to design services that are able to “hook” the customer in by designing
experiences to sustain a continuous usage (Nir, 2017).
No studies so far explored the previous stage of the adoption process: the decision to try a service and this
study aims at closing this gap.
We argue that theories about motivation and cognitive approaches can be leveraged to understand what
mistakes could reduce the propensity to try a new service. Starting from the theories belonging to Cognitive
Psychology (Kahneman, 2011; Kahneman and Tversky, 2013), and service usability (Fogg, 2009; Nielsen,
2012), this research aims to investigate the impact of the cognitive workload on service perception-evaluation,
being the cognitive load one of the elements affecting the learning process and thus, the usability (Sweller and
Chandler, 1991, Nielsen 2012). Perception, judgments formation and learning process overlap during the first
usage of a product/service and their collusion determine whether a person would be interested in using the
service or would be not.
Therefore, an experiment which involved the test of a prototype of a digital service, through a mobile app, has
been designed to test the two following hypotheses:
Hypothesis 1: an increase in the cognitive workload required to the user during the trial of a digital service
decreases his/her willingness to download and use it.
Hypothesis 2: a decrease in the usability of the services, due to the changes in the standard moves that a
user does while using a mobile app, decreases his/her willingness to download and use it.
The research design was based on three main steps. First, the basic app prototype and the relative manipulations
have been designed through a workshop with user-experience designers, using InVision to create a usable
prototype of the three versions of the service (the standard version and the manipulated versions for the two
hypotheses). Second, the experiment has been pre-test on 20 subjects with similar to those involved in the lab
experiment, this phase aimed to assure the reliability of the manipulations, asking the participants to describe
the differences between one of the two manipulated version and the basic one.
Third, 100 voluntary individuals participated in the lab experiment. It employed a 2x2 within-subject factorial
design (Fehr and Gachter, 2002), that manipulated (1) the cognitive bias (workload VS usability) and (2) the
order of test (testing first the basic prototype VS testing first the manipulated one), as shown in Figure 1.

Figure 1 – Within-subject factorial design: A – Standard version; B – Increased Cognitive workload; C – Decreased usability
Preliminary results show that both an increase in cognitive workload and a deviation from standard usability
decrease the willingness of users to download and use a service.
In particular, the impact of cognitive workload is much higher when individuals tested first the standard app
and then the manipulated one. This can build on the anchoring effect (Kahneman, 2011), showing that the
starting point can significantly influence the reaction of the individual testing the service. Furthermore, data
show that in the cases in which individuals have seen first the manipulated version (which requires a higher
cognitive effort) do not significantly change their choice when seeing the standard version. It seems that set a
higher load the individual is not properly able to perceive the decreased load in the second version, while it
may even appreciate some of the dynamics that increase the load – such as having many choices – because can
be perceived as an increased personality. This observation may be linked with the hooked mechanisms (Nir,
2017): from a service design perspective, it may be significantly different to design an app to make it more
downloaded and to increase the retention once it has been downloaded.
Shifting to the usability, no matter the order of the test, individuals seem to be very resistant to changes in the
standard positionings and movements within the app (Ram, 1989).
These observations can play a significant role for practitioners dealing with user experience. On the one hand,
the chance to simplify standard interfaces and flows may be perceived with extreme pleasure by the users,
especially if there is a dominant design in the field (Anderson and Tushman, 1990). On the other, there are
non-written rules regarding usability, which make users much more resistant to the product if they are not
followed. This study may represents a first exploratory research that digs in the role of cognitive biases in the
diffusion of digital services.","Anderson, P., & Tushman, M. L. (1990). Technological discontinuities and dominant designs: A cyclical

"BELTAGUI, AHMAD ","STYLOS, NIKOLAOS","SESIS, ACHILLEAS",,,,,3D PRINTING AS A CATALYST FOR ENTREPRENEURSHIP,"05 - Innovation Management in Start-ups, Small Firms and Collaborative Enterprises","Introduction and Objectives
The purpose of this study is to investigate how 3D printing (3DP henceforth) can help support entrepreneurs creation of new business ventures. A number of cases, both successful and unsuccessful, are investigated through an ethnographic study. Using an effectuation lens to analyse an ethnographic study, we uncover the mechanisms by which 3DP can catalyse entrepreneurship.
Phenomena such as open innovation and customer co-creation have shifted the focus of innovation management outside of established firms, and widespread digital connectivity has enhanced individuals’ ability to innovate and co-create. 3DP in particular, offers individuals enormous opportunities to transform their ideas into innovative products, through their own efforts and through collaborative design (Raasch et al., 2009; Rayna et al., 2015).
Some firms have begun to use 3DP as a means to create customised products for their consumers, for example Adidas Futurecraft range of apparel that can be 3D printed in store or Nu headphones, made to measure while the shopper waits. Some consumers, however, recognise in 3DP an opportunity to go from being consumers
to makers (Anderson, 2012). Makerspaces allow people to use technologies including 3DP to turn their ideas into designs and products (e.g. Halbinger, 2018).
➢ Brief literature mapping and key references
3DPrefers to a range of additive manufacturing processes, which create products by building up layers of plastic, metal or other material, directly from a digital design file. Since the first of these processes was patented in 1986, the range of technologies has grown and matured. And applications for 3DP have gone from prototyping early in the innovation process towards creation of end-use parts downstream (d’Aveni, 2015; Schniederjans, 2017; Candi and Beltagui, 2018).
The social (Bogers et al., 2016), environmental (Despeisse et al., 2017) and economic (Weller et al., 2015) implications are potentially enormous, providing fertile ground for research. And one particular area that demands attention is the role that 3D printing can play in supporting entrepreneurs in the early stages of new ventures (Mortara and Parisot, 2018).
Effectuation theory (Sarasvathy, 2001) is a useful underpinning framework to analyse the actions of entrepreneurs. Under this perspective, an entrepreneur has a long term goal and uses whatever resources are at hand to help achieve it (Witell et al., 2017). In this case, while 3DP empowers individuals, makerspaces offer networking and resource sharing, while 3DP in particular empowers individuals. How this empowerment is translated into business outcomes is revealed in this study.
➢ Approach/Method
The study applies a primary research scheme generating data from in-depth interviews and participant observation about the use of 3DP by would-be entrepreneurs in makerspaces and beyond. This approach has been widely used for studying innovation practice (e.g. Hargadon and Sutton, 1997) and helps to generate rich data on the phenomenonfrom case studies of successful and unsuccessful business ventures. The cases were based on observation over several months to examine and interpret practice, as well as face-to-face interviews focused on understanding the motivations and mindsets of the entrepreneurs.
➢ Findings
We find evidence that 3DP catalyses entrepreneurship by allowing individuals to take their desire to explore or create further. These individuals go beyond the limits of their knowledge and ability, solving problems pragmatically, if often not correctly, in an approach resembling effectuation. Once they move from exploring designs and tinkering with equipment, however, a change of mindset is required. We show that, contrary to expectations, the makers largely pursue individual goals, but those who succeed may be more effective in building collaborations and networks to access necessary skills. We highlight how the maker mindset continues, observed in elementary misjudgements, even as the business venture begins to grow.
➢ Conclusion and contribution to the field
Our first contribution is to demonstrate how people’s involvement in 3DP facilitates co-creation and open innovation. Those who take their creativity further use an effectuation mindset, using the tools at hand to overcome a lack of knowledge, experience or resources. Our second contribution is shows how this mindset helps, but also hinders the progress of a business venture, as the need to learn and follow rules becomes more pressing. Finally, the study contributes to knowledge on the motivations and interactions of makers.
➢ Managerial implications
For managers and would-be-entrepreneurs, the study offers insights into how 3DP can create new opportunities, but also how the technology and social interactions help or hinder progress.","Bogers, M., Hadar, R. and Bilberg, A., 2016.

"BELTAGUI, AHMAD ","BELL, ANDREW","CANDI, MARINA ",,,,,HARNESSING THE POWER OF EXPERIMENTATION THROUGH DESIGN THINKING AND AGILE METHODS,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"The early stages of innovation, particularly in complex or highly novel projects, are difficult to control and manage. Requirements may be poorly understood or subject to change. Reliable precedents may be hard to establish or follow. And the knowledge required to solve problems may be distributed. Given the prevalence of such projects, two particular approaches have rapidly gained popularity. Design thinking is widely applied for physical product development as well as service innovation, while agile methods are almost ubiquitous in software projects.
The purpose of this study is to investigate the overlaps between these approaches and, particularly, what lessons can be learned through cross-pollination. Through in-depth interviews with design engineers and project managers, the complementarities between the approaches are uncovered, generating insights for product, service and process innovation.
➢ Brief literature mapping and key references
The origins of the agile software development movement can be traced to Takeuchi and Nonaka’s (1986) seminal article on innovation in the Japanese automotive sector. In this context, innovation projects resemble rugby – a series of collective scrums and individual sprints – as opposed to the more common but less efficient relay race. This makes it logical that agile methods used by software teams should be applicable for contexts such as engineering product design (Rigby et al., 2016).
Agile methodologies encompass “ability for quick adaptation to changing requirements” (Kettunen, 2009, p. 408) and empower teams working closely with customers to create high-value and cost-effective outcomes through frequent short iterations. Both the close connection with customers and the dependence on an iterative development cycle align these methodologies closely with design-thinking (Brown and Martin, 2015; Verganti, 2009). The key aspects of the agile approach are collective effort, overlapping phases and iterative experimentation. These are also regarded as key aspects of design(erly) thinking (Johansson-Sköldberg et al., 2013).
Designers tend to follow a process of experimentation that revolves around iteration, trial and error and prototyping (Thomke, 1998). The role of the designer in this instance is to help elicit requirements through the use of prototypes – which may well be “low-fidelity” prototypes (Gerber and Carroll, 2012) – to reveal unknown-unknowns (Jensen et al., 2017). Early prototypes represent a low risk opportunity to fail and to learn through failure. They also allow for regular delivery of functionality in the same way that agile projects require delivery of working software code after each sprint. This approach is well suited to projects involving complexity and uncertainty, where experimentation helps to overcome initial ambiguity (Pich et al., 2002; Candi et al., 2013). Thus an agile project management approach, allied to a design thinking approach to problem solving, may show promise as an approach to innovation management.
➢ Approach/Method
Interviews were conducted with engineers and project managers involved in early-stage innovation projects. This was seen as an ideal context to examine the complementarities and possible combinations of agile and design-thinking methods. Interviews focused on two key topics. Firstly the nature of design work, with regard to how users are engaged and how iterative project phases are managed. And secondly, the use and value of low-fidelity prototypes or sketch models (Moultrie, 2015). The interviews, combined with participant observation of design teams in action are used to elaborate the
➢ Findings
The findings reflect the value of prototyping and iteration as a tool for a) generating ideas, b) testing and improving ideas, and c) establishing and understanding unstated requirements. The approaches and tools used are mapped across phases of project maturity. And this leads to insights regarding the use of tools and technologies such
as 3D printing, augmented reality and computer simulation, as well as the benefits of sketches and sketch models.
➢ Conclusion and contribution to the field
The study builds on prior research related to design practice, as well as seeking to link the academic debates relating to design-thinking and agile management. The contributions to knowledge are three-fold. Firstly, it reveals the ways in which technologies – old and new – enrich the armoury of the designer, by facilitating the exploration and communication of ideas. Secondly, it provides insights into the role of experimentation (Thomke, 1998) in innovation by examining the use of prototypes. And finally it builds on a review of agile and design-thinking methods to present a model and path for future research.
➢ Managerial implications
The study provides important examples and evidence to support innovation managers in the early stages of innovation. In particular, it reveals the value of iteration and experimentation. Agile project management emphasises these aspects and encourages them through timeboxes and daily standups. The study proposes an approach to integrating these agile practices into innovation projects, to enhance the effectiveness of designers.","Brown, T. and Martin, R.

"BEVERLAND, MICHAEL","CANKURTARAN, PINAR ","FARRELLY, FRANCIS",,,,,UNPACKING STRATEGIC DESIGN: EXPLORING THE NATURE OF DESIGN ORIENTATION IN FIRMS,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Some firms seem to be defined by the logic of design, with design playing a strategic
role that defines the firm’s identity and influences all of its operations (rather than
being contained within a functional boundary). Writers on design have long sort a
more strategic role for design within the firm, arguing that the logic and practice of
design can provide unique insights into how firms approach markets and value
(Beverland and Farrelly 2007; Beverland et al. 2015; Hart et al. 1989; Micheli et al.
2018). Micheli et al (2018) identified that strategic design meant design enjoyed
cognitive legitimacy internally, whereby its role as a key value driver across all aspects
of the firm’s operation was taken-for-granted. However, beyond practitioner
commentaries (Beverland and Farrelly 2007) and the identification of some structural
aspects of strategic design (i.e., that design’s role is formalized and communicated
across the firm) (Micheli et al. 2018), the exact nature of a design orientation remains
elusive (Beverland et al. 2017; Chen and Venkatesh 2013).
Drawing on depth interviews with designers and senior managers across 20
firms identified by an expert panel and published sources as being “design-led” (as
opposed to led by a designer) we explore the nature of strategic design orientation
as a culture and set of behaviours (much akin to research on market orientation). We
explored the nature of what it meant to be design-led with 13 industry experts,
before conducting 44 interviews at the firm-level with designers and senior
managers. Firms spanned a range of sectors including fashion, industrial engineering,
information technology, food and beverage, consumables, furniture, automotive and
transportation. The findings were population checked with 18 design experts.
Findings indicate that design orientation is a future focused logic aimed at
creating sustainable value for all the firms’ stakeholders through the physical and
experiential embodiment of the organization’s values across all aspects of
operations. Underpinning this are the following interrelated behaviours: market
shaping, disruptive differentiation, deep integration, and user empathy. Design
oriented firms placed a premium on shaping both in terms of challenging existing
market and firm logics and structures, and user behavior. They did this through
innovation that was often described as dissonance inducing for all stakeholders, that
worked back from future scenarios and latent user needs to create new product
solutions and systems. Consistent with previous work (Micheli et al. 2018) design’s
logic and appreciation went beyond functional boundaries and was embedded in the
processes, practices, identity and physical representation of all aspects of the firm.
Finally, design orientation was empathetic to the needs of all users, including internal
stakeholders and customers. This was achieved through problem focus, contextual
immersion, and an understanding of latent identity needs.
We posit that outcomes of design orientation include price premiums,
enduring brand relevance and differentiation, and sustained performance. Future
research should develop scales of design orientation and examine the links of this
construct to performance related outcomes. Barriers and drivers of design
orientation are explored to provide insight to innovation managers.","Beverland, M.B. and Farrelly, F.J (2007), “What does it mean to be ‘design-led’?”

"CANKURTARAN, PINAR ","BEVERLAND, MICHAEL",,,,,,INNOVATING AUTHENTICALLY: A QUALITATIVE META-SYNTHESIS,20 - Theory Development in Innovation Research,"There are few claims more compelling, and recently, more common, than ‘being authentic’ (defined
as ‘real, genuine, and true’ (Beverland and Farrelly 2010; Gilmore and Pine 2007). While marketers
have always made authenticity claims (Beverland 2005), business research on marketplace authenticity
(MPA), which concerns the production of authenticity within commercial contexts by marketplace
actors, has accelerated over the last two decades. In the innovation context, designers seek to maintain
authenticity through the use of an enduring design language or connections to conceptual purity in
their dealings with marketers (e.g., Micheli et al. 2012). Innovations must reinforce the brand’s
position ensuring that they are judged authentic by users, a process that may involve using behind the
scenes stories of product origin and creativity (Beverland et al. 2010). Open innovation involves issues
of authenticity as firms seek to extract value for user communities that are often defined by noncommercial
norms (e.g., Antinori et al. 2012), while innovation is often essential for consumers to
maintain product-brand relationships that reflect their authentication goals (Giesler 2012).
That said, the relationship between authenticity and innovation is rife with tension (see e.g., Carroll
and Swaminathan 2000; Glynn 20000). Furthermore, research on MPA and innovation remains
fragmented across disciplines, highly tied to context (e.g., particular industry clusters), and largely
qualitative in nature, leading to divergent and inconsistent findings, and impeding incremental theory
development (Newman and Smith 2016).
In this paper, we examine how authenticity within the context of innovation is rendered and conduct a
qualitative meta-synthesis (e.g., Timulak 2009) of the extant literature. Based on 59 primary studies,
we examine the tensions inherent in the MPA and explore the cues and processes/strategies
marketplace actors use when seeking to innovate authentically.
Consistent with the literature, we found that motivations for authenticity gave rise to paradox and
tension. These tensions must be ‘worked through’ for authentic innovation to occur, giving rise to
processes/strategies involving the use of select cues to these tensions. We show differences in the
number/type of processes used to address each tension, as well as patterns that align cues with
processes. Thus, we bring together the existing literature on innovating authentically, providing the
first, comprehensive review and theoretical synthesis, identifying new relationships.
In contrast to previous research that distinguishes between being (a reflection of some essential
character) and doing (a form of performance motivated by instrumental gain) authenticity as
oppositional (e.g., Rose and Wood 2005), whereby the former is genuine and the latter contrived, we
reframe innovation authenticity as a continuum of being and doing related tensions that must be
balanced over time. Those high in being but low in doing face marketplace hurdles representative of a
2
relevance deficit and are likely to fail or be more akin to artworks. Similarly, those high in doing but
low in being are likely to fail because they are judged insincere. Strategies to overcome each deficit
are identified. Thus, we also offer new theoretical insights on innovation authenticity. This helps
ground innovation authenticity theoretically, enabling scale development/testing, and empirical
validation.","Antinori, Y. M., A. M. Muñiz Jr., and T. Askildsen. 2012. Collaborating with customer communities:

"BOËNNE, MATHIAS","LETEN, BART","VAN DYCK, WALTER",,,,,HOW TO DESIGN IDEA TOURNAMENTS TO BOOST FRONT END SUCCESS – A QUALITATIVE COMPARATIVE APPROACH,01. Creativity in New Product Development,"Effectively managing the (fuzzy) front end is regarded as one of the hardest challenges - yet potentially most influential - when organizing the innovation process (Khurana & Rosenthal, 1997, Björk & Magnusson, 2009; Van den Ende et al., 2014). To tackle this challenge firms are frequently tapping into the collective intelligence of their employees by setting up idea tournaments (Cooper & Edgett, 2008; Terwiesch & Ulrich, 2009; Beretta et al., 2017). An idea tournament is a competition where participants strive to generate and ameliorate ideas to given challenges. The basic design of each idea tournament follows the same logic - participants respond to a challenge by submitting ideas who can be selected for further development or implementation. It creates a pool of ideas and extracts the most promising ideas from this pool (Terwiesch & Xu, 2008). But beyond this common structure significant differences in the way tournaments are designed exist (Terwiesch and Ulrich, 2009; Morgan & Wang, 2010). Over recent years, firms have extensively experimented with setting up idea tournaments, but many attempts do not live up to the hype, or even flat-out fail, largely because they are poorly designed (Cooper and Edgett, 2008; Terwiesch & Ulrich, 2009; Beretta et al., 2017).
Recently, innovation scholars have started highlighting a set of central design elements, and their respective impact on front end performance. In particular, empirical studies have focused on rewards for winners (Archak & Sundararajan, 2009), the optimal amount of contestants (Boudreau et al., 2011), individual versus team participation (Girotra et al., 2011), use of feedback systems (Wooten & Ulrich, 2017; Beretta, 2017; Zhu et al., 2018) and the role of tournament moderators (Beretta et al., 2017), adding piece-by-piece to the understanding how tournament design elements influence the outcome of developing ideas into practicable products or innovations.
The objective of this paper is to study how idea tournament design - as a holistic entity comprising a configuration of design elements - affects performance in the front end of the innovation process. In particular, we examine the interplay among the tournament design elements proposed by prior literature and show how they, in combination, impact a) the idea productivity of the firm (number of ideas generated), b) the idea effectiveness (implementation rate and success) and c) the engagement of the employees during the tournament. We study 30 internal idea tournaments, organized over the past 5 years. Data access is provided by collaborating with Yambla, an idea execution platform. Following a semi-structured interview approach with Yambla representatives combined and the firms that organized the idea tournaments, we map each tournament design combination and we record a series of front-end performance indicators of interest. Additionally, we capture online activity and performance from the platform. We perform a qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to identify which design combinations lead to higher (or lower) performance and which design elements are consistently present across cases with higher (or lower) performance (Thomann & Magetti,
2017Schneider & Wagemann, 2013, Ragin, 2014). In this way, we show what idea tournament design elements proposed by extant literature are sufficient, necessary or irrelevant to reach success in generating many ideas (idea productivity) on the one hand and at generating ideas of high value and implementation success (idea effectiveness) on the other. Vice-versa, we show how the absence of certain design elements can lead to failure on the same performance indicators.
The paper contributes both a summary of the extant literature on idea tournament design and shares a configurational and holistic understanding on how idea tournaments can be organized. Additionally, we present potential fruitful future avenues for research and practical recommendations for innovation practitioners.","Adamczyk, S., Bullinger, A., & Möslein, K. (2012).

"DALMAU, MERCÈ BONJORN","MAJBRITT, R. EVALD","MUNKSGAARD, KRISTIN B.",,,,,THE PROMISING ROUTE OF COMBINING LITERATURES OF SERVICE INNOVATION AND DESIGN THINKING,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Purpose. The purpose of the article is to critically analyze the current state of the research field of service innovation and identify how design thinking literature can help strengthen future theorization and research done in service innovation. The integration of the design thinking research is a key factor to develop service innovation. To facilitate this research, two analyzes are provided: past and present of the combination of both phenomena. The first, the theory of service innovation and design thinking are argued based on previous research because design thinking with stakeholders adds value to the service innovation. And, basically, because service innovation involves a new service offering co-creating value for stakeholders involved. Second, an overview of prior research is provided that connects the two research fields. This analysis is supplied to present how service innovation and design thinking currently is combined. And third, the paper is pinpointing future research needed to be able to progress the theoretical development of service innovation when combining it with design thinking.
The ambition is through design thinking to make it possible to gain more knowledge of how service innovation processes are developed and the importance of co-creation with diverse stakeholders.
Design/Methodology/Approach. A systematic literature review creates the basis for discussing the promising route of combining service innovation and design thinking, since it provides a transparent process to obtain an overview of current and future knowledge in the theoretical research fields of service innovation.
Findings. The main object of study is service innovation. This concept is still a field of young research that requires an in-depth study of the terminology used up to now. Thus, the first objective is to provide a clear overview of the different terminologies used to cover service innovation. Besides, the second objective is to organize the concepts related to design thinking. Third, in the field of design thinking there is a call for studies to investigate more and in what direction. Service design and innovation are important areas that need further exploration, development, and combination. For this reason, we will expose the needs detected on how design thinking can be integrated into service innovation practices and processes.
The findings are the following: first, there is ambiguity and lack of precision in the concept service innovation concept and the connection with design thinking. Second, there is an empirical demand to apply design thinking in the service innovation development. Third, the stakeholders become not only a necessity but also an opportunity to provide value to the service of innovation. Fourth, the stakeholders as a co-producers of service innovation.
Practical implications. With technology in mind, service innovation management means redesigning, adapting new and existing services to address frequent external changes and emerging opportunities for all stakeholders. Likewise, we try to provide an integrated vision of design as a process of co-creation and problem solving that involves all or key stakeholders.
Originality/Value. This research contributes to the existing literature in service innovation by providing more information on whether there is a relationship between the design thinking and development of service innovation, the importance of co-creation during the whole process, market complex with many stakeholders involved in the decision-making of the development and design of the service innovation.",,"Fuchs, C. and M.

"BUCK, LENNART SEBASTIAN","NILSSON , SUSANNE","RITZÉN, SOFIA ","KNOCHE, MIRIAM",,,,CRITICAL RESOURCES AND COMPETENCIES IN CREATING CORPORATE SPIN-OUTS,12 - Networks and Alliances in New Product Development,"In recent years the automotive industry has been hit by numerous changes through
transformation in and modifications to key technologies. Besides that, additional players with
new concepts have increased the competition (KPMG, 2018). Literature has found that more
dynamic market conditions, as they are appearing in the automotive industry today, call for
more exploratory actions by companies (Eisenhardt and Martin, 2000). However, traditional
automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) are usually set up more for
exploitation (e.g. Sørensen and Stuart, 2000, Sørensen, 2002, Burns and Wholey, 1993).
Hence, OEMs are searching for new ways of improving their capability to explore.
O’Reilly and Tushman (2013) call for research on how a company’s eco-system is
influencing its ambidexterity, i.e. the ability to explore and exploit. In this paper, the company
studied is experimenting to actively influence the eco-system by stimulating the creation of
spin-outs. Organizational separation is an approach often discussed in ambidexterity
literature (e.g. He and Wong, 2004, Tushman et al., 1996, Lavie et al., 2010), with spin-outs
being the most extreme version (e.g. Ahuja et al., 2008).
In this case, the motivation to create spin-outs was due to the availability of technologies
internally developed that had limited chance of being scaled up, e.g. because they do not fit
the core - business of the OEM. Since the OEM is not able to scale all technologies in-house
it is of interest to understand what resources and competencies would be needed to have
these technologies taken care of by spin outs instead. However, the creation of spin-offs has
been mostly discussed in university or publicly – funded context (e.g. Rasmussen et al.,
2014).
Therefore, this study wants to explore what is needed for the creation of a corporate spin-out
by answering the question:
What resources and competencies are needed to build corporate spin-outs from an
automotive OEM?
Method
A set of 19 semi-structured interviews (Saunders et al., 2009) has been performed. To get an
inside-in and outside-in - view, the authors chose to interview persons of different
background who were expected to have valuable insights to the research question. Seven
corporate founders, i.e. individuals that have worked in the case company before they
founded or tried to create their start-up; three from independent start-up companies and nine
experts in creating start-ups. The experts have different positions in accelerators, incubators
or company builders in different countries. The selection of these different interviewees
proved to be well-suited to generate valuable insights, which would not have been possible
with only one group. Interviews have been performed using a project journey approach
(Nilsson, 2017). They were transcribed and coded for resources and competencies needed
(Gioia et al., 2013).
Besides that, two of the authors were participating in most of the spin-outs creation
processes by internal founders. This participation allowed access to a plethora of archival
data in the form of e-Mails, notes, presentations, etc. that will be used to triangulate with the
findings from the interviews.
Preliminary Findings and contribution
Different categories of resources and competencies have been found. The resources
identified are classified according to financial, network, knowledge, time, human,
technological, and physical factors.
Competencies required can be split in four categories. (1) Professional, involving e.g. sales &
marketing, market comprehension, corporate requirements, and competition. (2)
Entrepreneurial, including besides others opportunity recognition and resource handling. (3)
Soft, which comprises of, for example, personal commitment, a willingness to learn, and selfawareness.
And (4) Transitional, needed to make the transition from corporation to start-up
by taking a risk and feeling comfortable in the start-up world. The latter competency is not
discussed in extant literature on spin-outs, making it particularly interesting to further study.
These findings add insights to theory and praxis by showing what companies may need to
influence their eco-system, potentially affecting their ambidexterity. Managerial implications
can be given on resources to provide and competence to build if spin-outs may be a valid
approach.","AHUJA, G., LAMPERT, C. M. & TANDON, V. 2008. Moving Beyond Schumpeter:

"RITZÉN, SOFIA ","NILSSON , SUSANNE",,,,,,MANAGING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION TO SUPPORT AMBIDEXTERITY,07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"It is well recognised that large mature firms are challenged by the need to efficiently deliver as
expected to the market and to create new deliverables that will succeed at a right timing, i.e. to be
ambidextrous (O’Reilly and Tushman, 2004; Mirow et al., 2008). Mature firms experience many
times tensions to being both efficient and innovative, since significantly different capabilities are
required both on an organizational and on an individual level. The most critical resource in
knowledge intensive firms is the knowledge and skills of employees (Grant, 1996). A diverse
knowledge spectrum among employees are therefore likely desirable, however, how diversity is
linked to performance outcomes show conflicting results (e.g. Pelled, 1996). Also, while teams
with high diversity has a broader compilation of different knowledges which is desirable for a
positive team outcome, intra-team conflicts tend to increase with increased team diversity as
stressed in a recent literature overview by Weiss et al. (2018). A skilfull management of diversity
through the use of different inclusion mechanisms related to climate, ways of working and
leadership is found to be useful to ensure the benefits from a diverse workforce (Shore et al.,
2011). Shore et al. define inclusion as a desirable stage where people in a group are integrated yet
acknowledged for their unique skills. How an inclusion strategy supportive to an ambidextrous
organization should be designed is considered particularly interesting to investigate, especially
since extent research focus rather on efficient than innovative groups. This study raises the
following research question:
How does managers inclusion efforts (managing diversity) relate to an organisations ability to be
both efficient and innovative?
Interviews with 6 second and 10 first line manager in an R&D organization of a mature and
global high tech firm have been conducted. R&D managers was selected since this group of
managers are considered to be particularly exposed to the conflicting demands resulting from an
organisations ambidexterity ambition. A survey with statements on a five step likert scale was
included in the interviews. Statements referred to diversity aspects and inclusion factors derived
from theory. Of particular interest is to investigate and compare departments that have different
working methods and work with different levels of newness in their deliverables.
Results reveal that a majority of the investigated groups are homogenous when it comes to
surface diversity factors as gender and nationality, and percieved as rather heterogenous when it
comes to deep factors such as communication preferences and desire to interact with collegues.
This is despite the differences in expected levels of innovation and efficiency. Some managers
face rather large challenges in securing a desired diversity especially when it comes to gender and
nationality. The study identifies different approaches to handle diversity in knowledge and skills
and how inclusion issues are coped with. Our study reveals a rather low level of maturity when it
comes to systematically manage diversity and secure inclusion in the organization. In addition, by
relating our result to recent literature on ambidexterity, diversity and inclusion, we propose a
number of research hypotheses to be further investigated.","Grant, R. (1996) Towards a knowledge-based view on the firm, Strategic Management Journal,

"CALABRETTA, GIULIA ","GEMSER, GERDA ",,,,,,CONTAGION THROUGH MATERIALITY: A PARADOX PERSPECTIVE ON COLLECTIVE ACCEPTANCE OF INNOVATION STRATEGIES,07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"In a fast-changing environment, the organizational capability of adopting and implementing
transformative innovation strategies is a critical driver of business competitiveness. Despite this
urgency, many companies still struggle with the required transformation, due to the internal
resistance of stakeholders and employees (Ganter and Hecker, 2013). The paradox perspective
explains resistance to change as an emotional and cognitive reaction to the paradoxical tensions
triggered by innovation (Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009). Accordingly, embracing innovation
requires the prolonged coexistence of contradictory, even mutual exclusive, mindsets and
processes (Smith and Tushman, 2005).
Paradoxical thinking is a strategy for managing paradoxical tensions through processes that
integrate the contradictory poles of the tension while maintaining and leveraging their differences
(Andriopoulos and Lewis, 2009; Smith and Tushman, 2005). Limited research efforts have been
directed towards understanding the individual practices for enacting paradoxical thinking, and,
most importantly, how these practices can influence other individuals in developing acceptance to
paradoxical thinking (Schad et al., 2016). In other words, there is a need for additional knowledge
on how individual practices of paradox management can become contagious and trigger social
aggregation around paradoxical thinking that is required for realizing organizational change
(Raisch and Birkinshaw, 2008).
In this paper, we want to explore this gap by focusing on the role of materiality in managing
paradoxical tensions at the individual level, and in triggering collective adoption of paradoxical
thinking. Materiality refers to all the visuals and artifacts individuals rely on for fulfilling their
tasks and for social interactions in organizational life (Dameron, Lê, and LeBaron, 2015). These
include tools like prototypes, drawings, and visual maps (Stigliani and Ravasi, 2012), but also
socio-material artifacts like locations, workshops, and spatial arrangements (Dameron et al., 2015).
Whilst prior studies suggest that materiality supports the achievement of a stable outcome (i.e., a
shared understanding), paradoxical tensions offer the opportunity to investigate the extent to which
material artefacts can also be used for creating acceptance for the persistent ambiguity required by
the prescribed strategies for managing paradoxes. Our goal is to extend those findings by providing
a deeper understanding of the role of materiality in the individual and collective management of
paradoxical tensions.
Our research entails a series of comparative case studies of innovation projects where
materiality is intensively used. Particularly, we selected cases from the design consultancy industry
as this industry makes large use of artefacts (e.g., drawings, prototypes, workshops) and social
interaction (e.g., co-creation with clients) in projects (Calabretta, Gemser and Wijnberg, 2016).
A preliminary analysis of the results points towards a categorization of different artefacts
based on their ability of supporting different strategies for managing paradoxical tensions (i.e.,
integration, differentiation, synthesis). Furthermore, whilst the artefact per se can be leveraged for
understanding and embracing paradoxical thinking, the collaborative process of developing an
artefact is the contagion mechanism (emotional, cognitive and behavioral) through which
acceptance of paradoxical thinking spreads from the individual to the collective level. Our findings
provide management some concrete insights, routed in material practices, to enhance adoption and
implementation of transformative innovation strategies.","Andriopoulos, C., & Lewis, M. W. (2009). Exploitation-exploration tensions and organizational

"CAMARGO, ANDRES","EHRENHARD, MICHEL",,,,,,INTERFIRM COOPERATIVES: PLATFORMS THAT ENHANCE ECOSYSTEMS IN NON-TECHNOLOGICAL MARKETS IN EMERGING ECONOMIES,12 - Networks and Alliances in New Product Development,"Digital technologies and new technological changes affected printing industry worldwide (DRUPA, 2017), challenging managers and firms to move beyond conventional thinking. Thus, firms has changed the way to work from go head-to-head battling for market share (Cusumano, 2010), to work in cooperative networks (Gulati, Nohria, & Zaheer, 2000). This study show the role that Interfirm Cooperative - IFCs - can play boosting business ecosystem in multisided market among its SMEs members within B2B relationships shaped in the printing industry. Given that the position in the network, IFC works as a focal firm (Powell, 2005), articulating business relationships with multiple actors.
In one hand, IFC is a specific type of cooperative enterprise owned by multiple firms (Hendrikse & Feng, 2013) studies identified that IFC’s help to solve market failures such as: lack of access to markets, lack of support services, price instability, and other barriers (Hendrikse & Feng, 2013; Hendrikse & Veerman, 2001). On the other hand, Scholars have stressed the need for change from product strategy to a complement strategy based on extensive collaboration networks (Adner & Kapoor, 2010), especially in buyer supplier relationships (Aoki & Wilhelm, 2017; Dyer, 1996; Dyer & Hatch, 2006). Research undertake this challenges through frameworks such as: network management, business ecosystems (Aarikka-Stenroos & Ritala, 2017) and alliances (Ahuja, 2000; Gulati, 1998; Moller & Halinen, 1999; Moore, 1993). Further, studies identified as a key element, the success of the networks of companies which focal firms do business (Adner, 2006; Iansiti & Levien, 2004). three characteristics identify business ecosystem: the platform, symbiosis, and co-evolution (Li, 2009), the concept is used in strategy research (Iansiti & Levien, 2004; Moller & Halinen, 1999; Moore, 1993). Likewise, stakeholders within the ecosystem attain a certain level of symbiosis (Ehrenhard, Kijl, & Nieuwenhuis, 2014) Hence, value network can be seen as a specification or subset of a business ecosystem (Nieuwenhuis, Ehrenhard, & Prause, 2018) value networks exist with a linked components and multiple interdependencies alike. Likewise, the value is created outside firm's boundaries in collaboration with competitors (Tushman, 2004).
By adopting an platform and business ecosystem approach (Aarikka-Stenroos & Ritala, 2017; Thomas, Autio, & Gann, 2014), in this study we analyse IFC role in the context of Colombian printing industry. We demonstrate how IFC and its SMEs members can collaborate to strategically build up this supportive external environment. We conducted a case study (Yin, 2014) to determine the underlying value creating system of the business ecosystem surrounding IFC. The fieldwork was carried out between Jun 2016 and November 2018. Data was collected from various sources, semi-structured interviews with IFC board members, manager, support team, and other actors, archival data, documents, and field observations.
Our findings provide in-depth insights about IFC’s role as platform of business ecosystems, In particular, this study highlights the importance of IFC as a focal firm that boost collaboration among its members, and various stakeholders. Likewise, due to new ways to deliver value, rise the interactions with complementors, government institutions and others. Thus, IFC can be seen as a platform of business ecosystem in this industry. Our findings also help managers to understand and tackle challenges involved to create collaboration networks, even more in a B2B context where all its members are competitors in the same market.","Aarikka-Stenroos, L., & Ritala, P.

"CANTERINO, FILOMENA","PELLIZZONI, ELENA ","BUGANZA, TOMMASO",,,,,OPENING THE INNOVATIVE TEAM BLACK-BOX: A TEAM-CENTRIC APPROACH OVER TIME,16 - Organising New Product Development,"When dealing with innovation, effective teamwork is one key driver for companies, since innovation efforts usually require multidisciplinary teams facing high-level of complexity (Hulsheger et al., 2009). Despite the richness of research about teams and dynamics, how to set high performance teamwork is still unclear in practice (O’Neill and Salas, 2018). Recent studies in team-related domain of research suggests to adopt a person- or team- centric approach in order to disentangle the black-box of team effectiveness, juxtaposed to the traditional variable-centric approach (e.g. O’Neill et al., 2017). Person- or Team- centric approaches ‘holistically examine multiple properties of individuals or groups simultaneously and assume that there are qualitatively distinct patterns’ (Shuffler et al., 2018, p. 362) that determine specific team profiles, that in turn may affect performance. Therefore, effectiveness of a team in a specific context - such as innovation-related efforts - may depend on its profile, for example in terms of conflict management styles or leadership approaches, not just considered as individual variables but as characteristics at the team level.
Given the above, the present study aims at identifying which are the team profiles that are more effective when dealing with innovation efforts and performances over time and the relationship between the team and the individual profiles in the delivery of high-quality results. We analyze the team and the individual profiles on three main characteristics: task orientation, people orientation and innovation orientation (Bass, 1990; Scott and Bruce, 1994).
The selected empirical field is the innovation program developed in banking company, aiming at improve the digitalization of processes. The program was attended by forty selected participants split into five groups. The teams competed on four innovation challenges for a total time of 8 months. We performed a longitudinal analysis of the teams’ dynamics and their profiles (both at the individual and at the team level), combining quantitative (i.e. 7 surveys along the process) and qualitative data. Moreover, for each challenge a jury composed by 5 top managers defined the final ranking and elaborated a team-based breakdown of the results (e.g. quality of the idea, feasibility). These feedbacks have been used as an objective and impartial evaluation of the quality of the work developed by the teams along the four challenges. Finally, we combined the quantitative data with five focus groups, aiming at contextualize the quantitative results (Alvesson and Sköldberg, 2009).
Preliminary results suggest strong correlation between the performance of the team, teams’ dynamics and individual orientations. Individual profiles influence the team profile but, in accordance with previous literature, the team profile goes beyond the sum of the individual characteristics with regard to task, people and innovation orientation (O’Neill et al., 2017). Moreover, the individual growth during the program is strongly influenced by the team profiles: employees seem to be growing thanks not only to the innovative program itself but also to the team and its dynamics (Hackman et al, 2000).
Finally, the team profile, more than the individual ones, seems to influence the innovation performances (Hulsheger et al., 2009).
Findings can shed light on how team dynamics and its profile can actually influence the outcome of an innovation program and how individuals grow through these innovation paths, thanks to team dynamics. The output of this research can be also useful for managers who want to create innovation programs to understand how to better support teams towards successful results.","Alvesson, M. and Sköldberg, K.

"PELLIZZONI, ELENA ","PATRUCCO, ANDREA",,,,,,AGILE AND TRADITIONAL PROJECT MANAGEMENT METHODS: THE STRATEGIC RELEVANCE OF THE PRODUCT VISION PHASE,16 - Organising New Product Development,"Today's competitive scenario requires companies to be ready to react to new challenges and
opportunities continuously provided by new entrants with potential disruptive effects (e.g., Downes
and Nunes, 2014). In the context of software development, the need to respond to higher levels of
volatility and uncertainty has pushed practitioners to create in 2001 a new approach to the
management of software development processes, Agile (e.g., Fowler and Highsmith, 2001;
Cockburn, 2002). There is evidence that Agile represents a paradigm shift that has improved the
typically low success rates of software innovation projects (e.g., Misra et al., 2009). Even in
traditional non-software industries, most innovation initiatives fail to meet time, cost and quality
objectives (e.g., Castellion and Markham, 2013). In the attempt to improve performance, scholars
and practitioners are increasingly considering Agile as promising management approach (Conforto
et al. 2014; Conforto et al., 2016; Serrador and Pinto, 2015) that can be applied in large organizations
(e.g., Hobbs and Petit, 2017). In this setting, the Agile approach should often coexist with traditional
methods giving the birth to intermediate or hybrid approaches (Cooper and Sommer, 2016; Conforto
et al. 2014).
Consequently, companies should face several challenges (Dikert et al., 2016): the interfaces between
the two approaches should adequately manage in order to reduce coordination and culture issues
(Denning, 2016). In this vein, authors focus on managerial practices that facilitate the hybrid model
(Cooper and Sommer, 2016; Conforto et al. 2014), concentrating on the implementation phases in
according to the Agile literature. The Agile methodologies indeed are described in detail mainly in
the implementation process, but the guideline on the initial phase - product vision - are often vague
(e.g., Fowler and Highsmith, 2001; Knapp et al., 2016). The initial vision, however, “plays an
important role in bringing a new product to life"" and can be used in order to guide people in the same
direction effectively and the chances of creating a successful product are higher (Pichler, 2018)
This research aims to investigate how to manage the product vision in order to reduce the tensions
between agile and traditional approach. Through a multiple case study (Yin, 2013), this paper draws
on exploratory research with a double goal: i) to understand how product vision may enable the
interface between agile and traditional approaches and ii) to study the main challenges that can be
managed within this phase. A network of Agile coaches was analyzed, and eight Agile coaches were
selected and interviewed in order to understand how they structure the initial phase of the project. All
the interviews have been transcribed and coded (Saldana, 2012). Secondary sources have been used
to triangulate the gathered information and to increase the reliability of the results.
Preliminary results suggest, in line with previous literature, that a structured process of product vision
is essential to reduce interface problems and increase performances of overall methodology (Cooper
and Sommer, 2016). Several challenges have to be faced by managers employing agile in traditional
companies and some interesting managerial practices are presented. These findings allow developing
a four-stage process for product vision phase of the Agile approach in traditional companies, which
represents a relevant theoretical and managerial contribution to the field.","Castellion, G., & Markham, S. K. (2013). Perspective: new product failure rates: influence of

"PIÑA, CARLOS ALBERTO CARBAJAL","ACUR, NURAN ","SMART, ALISON",,,,,BUSINESS MODELS FOR INDUSTRY 4.0: CONCEPTUALIZING A NEW PARADIGM USING TECHNOLOGY AFFORDANCES AND CONSTRAINS THEORY,"09 - Managing Innovation in IT, AI and Software","This research examines the inter-linking of business model innovation and Industry 4.0 using the lenses of Technology Affordances and Constraints Theory (TACT). Through bibliometric analysis, this 10 study identifies linkages and gaps in the development of management knowledge and develops a framework to help researchers and practitioners in understanding to what extent the effect that technologies have in business model innovation and organisational value creation for Industry 4.0.
Industry 4.0 refers to the increase in automation and information exchange in manufacturing processes (Reinert, 2016). It is expected that Industry 4.0, and its underlying technologies, will 15 transform the current manufacturing paradigm. However, these emerging technologies offer little guidance to scholars who “must have clear sets of concepts about the objects they study in order to conduct cumulative and comparable research.” (Wolfe, 1994, p. 406). Alternatively, some studies have suggested the use of business models as an orchestrating method for Industry 4.0 (Gawer and Cusumano, 2014); however, there is little research that contributes to the knowledge base on its 20 design and implementation (Schneider, 2018). Furthermore, while a few scholars highlighted aspects of how value is created by Industry 4.0 technologies (Kiel et al., 2017), there has been no conceptualisation, to date, of an explicit research agenda that can simultaneously consolidate and progress the domain.
Recent approaches emphasise the outcomes that emerge from socio-material interactions; for 25 example Technology Affordance and Constraint Theory (TACT) (Majchrzak and Markus, 2012). From a materiality perspective, organisation forms and work patterns are determined by the material characteristics of Industry 4.0 underlying technologies. Instead, from the social perspective, technology is socially constructed and perceived as a product of purposeful business model design about organisational norms and value creation. 30

As such, technology affordances and constraints are relational properties that are separate from the object or actor itself, and only exist from the intertwining of both that, either enable or constrain a set of specific use behaviours (Zammuto et al., 2007). TACT provides a framework to assess practices involving technology, develop benchmarks across organisations, and examine interactions between features and purposes of technology (Majchrzak and Markus, 2012). Thus, the results of the 35 bibliometric analysis are interpreted using TACT, which advances the conceptual understanding of the role of technology in business model innovation for Industry 4.0—that is, technology affords or constraints a particular action potential when in the hands of a specific user or organisation—and provides an agenda for future research.
APPROACH/METHOD 40
This paper uses bibliometric, and text mining techniques to (1) examine and map the existing literature on business models and Industry 4.0, (2) classify existing research streams and propose potential new ones, and (3) assess the role of technology in the development of business models for industry 4.0.
Citation-based analyses are wildly used to establish the conceptual and intellectual structure of a literature body, the bibliographical coupling is particularly useful to address emergent streams, as this 45 technique assesses the theoretical richness of such literature (Zupic and Čater, 2014). Finally, to compensate for some of the limitations of citation-based analyses, a text mining technique is used to identify stronger relations between publications (Glänzel, 2012).
DATA/FINDINGS
The preliminary results of the bibliometric analysis offer a glimpse of the conceptual and intellectual 50 structure of the literature considered. Through the content analysis of the abstracts of each publication, the literature body is organised in clusters according to their mutual correspondence. Figure 1 shows the most significant words used in the abstracts of each cluster, and Figure 2 shows the most influential articles for each cluster. However, an additional examination is required to identify the prevalent affordances and constraints for each cluster. 55

CONCLUSION AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD
This research is distinctive as it is informed by a theoretical and empirical conceptualisation of Industry 4.0 from three perspectives: technological development, business model innovation and value creation. We explore these perspectives in-depth to identify linkages between key constructs and develop our framework; this adds to the literature on industry 4.0 from a strategic standpoint and 65 serves as a basis for future study.
MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
This research also anticipates being of importance to practitioners by providing insights into the challenges encountered by empirical research carried out in the topics of business models and industry 4.0. Alternately, this study seeks to classify the research done according to their level of 70 maturity; this is the number and impact of publications in each of the research stream encountered.","Gawer, A. and Cusumano, M.

"CARBONELL, PILAR","RODRIGUEZ-ESCUDERO, ANA I.","CHUANG, YOU-TA",,,,,THE MODERATING EFFECT OF TRANSACTIVE MEMORY SYSTEMS ON THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN TEAM BOUNDARY SPANNING ACTIVITY AND PRODUCT CREATIVITY,08 - Managing Knowledge and Information Systems in New Product Development,"In today’s highly interconnected, fast-paced, and competitive business environment, new product development (NPD) teams depend, more than ever, on their ability to span boundaries and interact with parties external to the team; an activity typically referred to as team boundary spanning (Marrone, 2010; Cross et al., 2015). Team boundary spanning represents a team’s actions to establish links and manage interactions with individuals and groups inside (e.g., upper management, functional management) and outside (e.g., customers, suppliers, distributors, inventors) the organization with the purpose of coordinating NPD activities, obtaining information and resources and building support for the team and the NPD project (Ancona et al., 2009). Team boundary spanning has been shown to positively influence a number of new product performance outcomes (Ancona and Caldwell, 1992; Carbonell and Rodriguez-Escudero, 2017).
That said, recent empirical work suggests that the importance of team boundary spanning activity on team performance can depend upon team characteristics as a team needs to possess the ability to integrate and transform information and resources into desired outcomes (Maurer et al., 2011). However, how team characteristics affect the effect of team boundary spanning activity on product innovation is not yet well understood in the literature. Against this backdrop, the current study builds upon the literatures on team boundary spanning and transactive memory systems (TMS) to examine the moderating impact of TMS on the effects of internal (within-the-firm) and external (outside-the-firm) boundary spanning activity on new product creativity. We focus on product creativity because it is a critical aspect of product innovation and performance. A TMS refers to the cooperative division of labor for learning, remembering and communicating relevant team knowledge (Lewis, 2003). Through a TMS, team members know who knows what in the project, trust the reliability of that knowledge, and organize this differentiated knowledge effectively (Lewis, 2003). Research has suggested that a team with a better TMS tends to have a better team performance as the TMS allows members to capitalize each other’s knowledge and enhances coordination among members (e.g., Akgün et al., 2006; Dayan and di Benedetto, 2011). In this study, internal and external team boundary spanning are expected to have positive effects on new product creativity. Regarding the moderating effect of TMS, we hypothesize that for NPD teams with a better TMS, the positive effects of internal and external team boundary spanning on product creativity will be stronger as the teams will have a better ability to integrate and transform information and resources into product creativity.
Data to test our hypotheses were collected from 140 manufacturing firms in high and medium-high technology sectors. Unit of analysis was the new product development project. Study constructs were measured using established scales in the literature. Reliability, convergent and discriminant validity for the scales were all confirmed. The proposed model was tested using Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modeling (PLS-SEM) algorithm (Smart PLS 3.1.5). Results show a direct positive effect of external boundary spanning on new product creativity. The effect of internal boundary spanning on new product creativity was not significant. Regarding the moderating effects, TMS does not moderate the effect of external boundary spanning on creativity. Surprisingly, the interaction effect of internal boundary spanning activity and TMS is negative (p <.01). This suggests that internal boundary spanning activity is more important when a team does not have a well-developed TMS.
The results of our study have important theoretical and managerial implications. From a theoretical perspective, our results suggest that it is critical to decompose team boundary spanning
into external and internal to better understand its role in improving team creativity. Most importantly, our moderating results of TMS suggest that there is a substitution effect of team characteristics and internal boundary spanning activity. From a managerial perspective, findings from our study suggest that external boundary spanning activities promote new product creativity. Regarding internal boundary spanning, results suggest that for NPD teams with a less developed TMS, the team leader should encourage team members to engage in internal boundary spanning activity in order to enhance product creativity. In contrast, for NPD teams with limited internal boundary spanning opportunity, the team leader should focus on the development of TMS to enhance team performance such as product creativity.","Akgün, A.

"CHIBBA, ARON",,,,,,,OBSTACLES FOR CREATIVITY IN THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PROCESS - A CASE STUDY PERFORMED IN ISO 9001 CERTIFIED COMPANIES,01. Creativity in New Product Development,"Research within management and organization indicates that innovative companies are more profitable than other companies (Tidd et. al. 1997). To work with innovations can be a risky business and difficult to organize, however since the 1980s many models has been presented to organize the design and development process. In 1987 the international standard ISO 9001 made it possible for organisations to certify their business with focus on quality management. The standard also states requirements for design and development, which must be fulfilled by organisations that are going for a certification, if they work with design and development. However, a study performed by ISO revealed that the requirements regarding design and development process was pointed out as a difficult requirement to manage by the certified organisations. If quality management in its sense of origin accounts for the structuring and control of processes, innovation stands for something new to the market and change. Already, Joseph Schumpeter believed that radical innovations lead to the necessary decomposition of existing structures. He called this for creative destruction (Schumpeter, 1934). The reasoning was that while innovation is necessary for new development steps, existing knowledge and structure are less valuable when developing new knowledge and structures. A problem that is often described in the development of radical product innovations is that the prospective customer is not aware of the benefits that innovation may entail. This means that the concept of customer focus from quality management must be based on unprecise criteria and a user focus initiated by the product developer rather than criteria initiated from the customer department's marketing departments (see for example Utterbach, 1994). This paper is based on a qualitative study with results from cases performed in ISO 9001 certified companies. The criteria for the studied companies are that they must: 1) have a certification to ISO 9001 for more than 5 years, 2) have no exclusions from requirements, 3) design and develop new and own products, 4) be an industry-leading company. Based on the results from the case studies, a foundation for a combined model for fulfilling both the requirements in ISO 9001:2015 and theory of Innovation Management will be created. The main question that will be answered is: How can theory of Innovation Management and the concept of creativity fit in and contribute to the design and development process in an ISO 9001 certified company? The focus of this paper will be to highlight the potential obstacles between the requirements of design and development in the quality management standard ISO 9001:2015 and the theory of Innovation Management including the complex task of being creative. We will also discuss how the model can be used and further developed by small and medium-sized companies.","Dilani Jayawarna, Alan W.

"CHRISTIANSEN, JOHN K. ","GASPARIN, MARTA",,,,,,FROM KNOWLEDGE TRANSFER TO PROCESSES THAT CREATES KNOWING IN RADICAL INNOVATION PROCESSES,08 - Managing Knowledge and Information Systems in New Product Development,"The processes to manage innovation and product development are divided and organized in phases or teams (Lawrence, & Lorsch, 1967) which need to be coordinated and integrated the parts. The coordination and integration involve knowledge transfer and knowledge creation, and the present research will propose a dynamic view on knowledge, moving away from knowledge transfer towards a view analyzing the processes that creates knowing.
Innovation and design processes have multiple stakeholders, human and non-human actors, inside and outside the company, and representatives from institutional organizations (environmental agencies etc.). The present analysis will focus on the role of manufacturing in the design processes.
The Danish industry has considered design and innovation to be critical for the competitive advantage (Design Denmark, 2007), while the European Union has addressed it as a tool to leverage innovation (EU report, Helsinki, 2012). Several studies have agreed with the fact that companies that actually consider design as an important driver can achieve higher profits than those who do not (Hertenstein et al., 2005; Chiva-Gomez and Alegre, 2009). Even though the efficient and effective management of the design processes are relevant to the successful launch in the market of a new product, design management has been investigated in the field of product innovation management (for example, Chiva and Alegre, 2009; Dumas and Mintzberg, 1989, 1991; Kotler and Rath, 1984; Walsh, 1996), but design issues and the importance of design management has not been fully explored in operations management (as already Singhal, 2002 noticed). One possible explanation can be found in Ahire and Dreyfus (2000), who assert that design management efforts involve long-term work in the background while process management is usually more visible yet tactical.
Lately knowledge has been recognized as being a source of competitive advantage (Hislop, 2013). Aligned with this argument, Swart (2011) illustrates how knowing creates value, and Bogner and Bansal (2007) demonstrate that knowledge management system, comprised of both intermediate knowledge outcomes and an ongoing learning process, are contributing to the competitive advantage of the firms in dynamic environments, and are the basis for sustained high performance. Within the area of product innovation management there is a long tradition for the study of the acquisition, application and use of knowledge and what information is best suited when and where in the NPD processes, e.g. calibrating customer knowledge according to the type of innovation (O’Connor, 1998); challenges with the extraction of tacit knowledge from NPD projects (Goffin & Koners, 2011); direct integration of knowledge and requirements from customers (Ogawa & Piller, 2006) or how knowledge creation is related to socialization processes (Schulze Hoegl, 2006).
Various frameworks have been suggested to capture the various views on knowledge, and Blacker (1995) has presented knowledge as embodied, embedded (meaning that knowledge is located in bodies and routines) embrained, encultured and encoded (emphasizing the fact that knowledge is located in brains, dialogues and symbols. However, it has been suggested that we should focus on the processes that leads to knowing rather than to focus on the explication of tacit knowledge and the packing and transfer of knowledge (Blacker, 1995). Among his arguments are briefly that knowing is always mediated, situated, provisional and pragmatic, and the outcome of relationships between actors. So rather, ""than talking of knowledge, with its connotations of abstractions, progress, permanency....it is more helpful to talk about the process of knowing, e.g. as Brown et al. (1989) and Lave and Wenger (1991) who focus on how groups develop shared conceptions of their activities. We propose these theoretical lenses as an alternative to the present view on knowledge and knowledge management inherent in innovation research.
We have collected four cases in which three shows a very interactive collaboration involving manufacturing and the design-team (including top-management) and marketing.

"COUGHLAN, PAUL ","DE ALMEIDA KUMLIEN, ANA",,,,,,"LEARNING TO INNOVATE THROUGH ACTION LEARNING, COLLABORATIVE PROTOTYPING AND DEMONSTRATION",12 - Networks and Alliances in New Product Development,"Objectives and theoretical and practical relevance
The question addressed in this paper is: how can action learning, collaborative prototyping
and demonstration impact learning to innovate? The theoretical objectives are: to explore
the interaction of action learning and collaborative prototyping in a learning network of
researchers and practitioners; to explore demonstration as a learning mechanism usable by
the network. The practical objective is to identify what needs to happen prior to, during and
after a network visit to a demonstration site to ensure learning in action and innovation.
Brief literature mapping and key references
Prototypes serve various purposes including learning, communication and integration
(Ulrich, 2003). They can be developed collaboratively in cycles of trial and error (von Hippel
and Katz, 2002; Baskaran, Nachiappan and Rahman, 2012; Bogers and Horst, 2014;
Gabrielsson et al., 2018). Network action learning is a learning mechanism exposing extant
knowledge to questioning from action, combined with organisational and interorganisational
insights (Coughlan and Coghlan, 2011). Collaboration and engagement involve
facilitation, a common language and trust (Obstfeld, 2005; Hemphälä and Magnusson, 2012).
Emergent learning can be captured, codified and shared to enhance capabilities through
mechanisms including organisational structures and processes (Shani & Docherty, 2008).
Demonstration is related to prototyping and may accelerate innovation (Kreijns, Gerardts
and Rutten, 2018). It incorporates learning in action and collaborative prototyping. However,
suitability of demonstration sites is key (Bikfalvi et al., 2018).
Theoretical development and research model
The conceptual framework in Figure 1 illustrates our approach. It connects a network of

collaborative prototyping and visits to demonstration sites. The emergent learning is

Approach/Methods
The research question is explored in the context of innovation in energy recovery at three
demonstration sites in a water industry learning network (Figure 2). The active nature of the
question suggests an action learning research design based upon demonstration of
technology as an intervention in order to generate actionable insights (Coughlan & Coghlan,
2011). Data collection includes structured engagement, site visits, note-taking, meetings,
document review and participant feedback.
Figure 2. Three demonstration sites in Ireland and Wales.
Findings & Results
The three sites involve the demonstration of different energy recovery technologies, codesigned
and co-created in different operating contexts and with different partners. The
theoretical insights are expected to explicate the capture in learning mechanisms of how
action learning interacts with collaborative prototyping and demonstration to inform
learning to innovate. The practical findings are expected to inform how a demonstration site
can be exploited to ensure actionable learning towards long term innovation.
Conclusion and contribution to the field
The paper will present evidence of a relationship between action learning, collaborative
prototyping and demonstration which contributes to learning to innovate. Reflections on
this evidence will lead to actionable insights, contributing to collaborative prototyping in a
network.
Managerial implications
The immediate benefit will be to partner organisations engaged in innovative energy
recovery from their water assets. Guidelines to facilitate and enable learning are planned to
help stakeholders to learn how to manage innovation enabling sustainable production and
use of water.","Baskaran, V., Nachiappan, S. and Rahman, S. (2012) ‘Indian textile suppliers sustainability

exploration (Lavie et al., 2010). Organizations that overinvest in exploitation by focusing on efficiencies from
current knowledge run the risk of being trapped by their own success. Organizations that excessively focus on
experimentation never gain the financial rewards of new inventions and become trapped by failure (March, 1991;
Levinthal and March, 1993). In the past decades, scholars have provided valuable insights into the organizational
antecedents of exploration and exploitation and proposed various strategies of timing both activities (e.g.
Tushman and O’Reilly, 1996; Gibson and Birkinshaw, 2004; Lubatkin et al., 2006). Firms may successfully combine
exploration and exploitation by transitioning from exploration to exploitation and vice versa, or by performing
both activities simultaneously in a parallel fashion (Birkinshaw and Gibson, 2004).
So far, the innovation management literature has remained relatively silent on how to monitor the extent to
which companies invest resources in explorative versus exploitation. Prevention of success and failure traps
requires analysis of innovation project portfolio composition and the changes in resources that a company
allocates to exploration and exploitation over time. This analysis is difficult as innovation project portfolios are
often composed of a large number of projects. It is also much time consuming to continuously evaluate the
dynamics of a complex innovation project portfolio mix. Recently, scholars have started to take a dynamic
perspective on analyzing exploration-exploitation balance levels ex post (e.g. Chou et al., 2017; Luger et al.,
2018). These studies, however, do not provide ways to ex ante evaluate innovation portfolio dynamics – when
the innovation activities are being performed. This is crucial for success and failure trap prevention: in order to
evaluate whether a company might run the risk of overinvesting in either exploration or exploitation and
anticipate, management should have real-time insight into the innovation portfolio composition.
In this study, a machine-based tool is developed to analyze innovation portfolios of industrial firms in degrees of
exploration and exploitation, that help managers to diagnose and mitigate success and failure traps. We
demonstrate how ex ante – before product launch – the composition of innovation portfolios can be monitored
by applying machine-learning techniques. Based on a unique dataset comprising of 5901 innovation project
descriptions and time-accounting data obtained from 440 manufacturing firms operating in various industries,
we develop classifiers using semi-supervised natural language processing algorithms that enable practitioners
and scholars to automatically classify large numbers of innovation project descriptions. For practitioners, the text
mining algorithms we develop can be used to monitor shifts in complex innovation project portfolios and detect
exploration trends. Analyzing such trends can help to identify risks of running into success and failure traps. We
contribute to theory testing by providing ways for scholars to measure portfolio dynamics and test hypotheses
about financial performance implications of various exploration-exploitation timing strategies under various
environmental conditions.","Birkinshaw, J., & Gibson, C. (2004). Building an ambidextrous organisation.","2- Van Dijk, Christiaan, and Jan Van Den Ende. ""Suggestion systems: transferring employee creativity into

"DE WEERD-NEDERHOF, PETRA ","HATAK, ISABELLA ","KUIJPERS, KOEN","CANIELS, MARJOLEIN",,,,INDIVIDUAL RESILIENCE FOR INNOVATION: DOES CONTEXT MATTER?,06 - Innovation Management for Resilience,"It is an understatement to say that individual resilience is important to organizational
outcomes, and not surprisingly scholars have been interested in exploring the issue.
Individual resilience captures the extent to which employees successfully deal with change
and setbacks at work and to which they adapt accordingly to thrive in a new environment
(Näswall et al., 2015). Individual resilience has been related to higher levels of job
performance and organizational commitment (Meneghel et al., 2016; Youssef & Luthans,
2007) and employee creativity (Huang & Luthans, 2015), but the question of how individual
resilience affects innovation behaviour has received little to no attention in the literature.
Theoretically, it is possible that individual resilience hinders or improves innovative
work behaviour, depending on the organizational environment in which the individual is
embedded. In other words, what is functional and dysfunctional in terms of individual
characteristics is largely a matter of context, as reflected in the person-environment fit
literature (Kristof-Brown et al., 2005). To date, however, no studies address organizational
environmental “fit” in terms of enhanced innovative work behaviour for resilient individuals.
This is surprising given the dearth of resilience research standing in contrast to the widely
accepted view that environmental context is a significant predictor of resilience, and that
environmental context can be functional or dysfunctional for innovation outcomes.
Empirically testing the innovation effects of individual resilience in conjunction with the
characteristics of the organizational environment, that is the firm’s innovation orientation and
leadership orientation, is therefore this study’s main aim. A key feature of this research is
thus the contingency perspective we adopt in exploring the role of resilience for innovation –
specifically innovative work behaviour (Janssen, 2000).
We draw upon the person-environment fit literature as applied in innovation research
(e.g. Choi, 2004; Choi & Price, 2005; Ng & Lucianetti, 2016) and currently rely on data from
62 employees of a Dutch company in transition to improving innovation (wave 1; the threewave
longitudinal data-gathering process will be finished in the first half of 2019), using
validated scales to test our direct and moderation hypotheses..
Our preliminary regression analytical findings suggest that individual resilience is
positively related to innovative work behaviour. Importantly, the resilience-induced
improvements in innovative work behaviour are not affected by the organizational
environment.
This paper contributes to the resilience literature by finding support for the positive
resilience-innovative work behaviour relationship. Furthermore, we contribute to scholarship
on innovation management by highlighting the context-free innovation benefits of individual
resilience. In other words, for individual resilience to unfold their behavioural innovation
effects, it seems not to matter whether the organization is focusing on exploratory or
exploitative innovation (Jansen et al., 2006), and neither does it show leadership style (Avilio
& Bass, 2015) affecting the innovation outcomes of resilient individuals.
Studying the resilience-innovation nexus is practically relevant: As resilience is
conducive to more innovative work behaviour – independently of the organization’s
innovation orientation or leadership approach –the hiring of resilient individuals and provision
of employee training for strengthening individual resilience are recommended to any
organization for improving innovation.","Avolio, B.J. & Bass, B.M. (1995). Individual consideration viewed at multiple levels of

Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Scholars and practitioners are acknowledging the central role that design can play in innovation (Brown, 2009; Martin, 2009; Verganti, 2009 and 2017; Verganti and Dell’Era, 2014; Liedtka, 2013; Kolko, 2015; Kleinsmann, Valkenburg and Sluijs, 2017). Design is increasingly becoming a strategic source of competitive advantage, to the point that scholars investigate its managerial side and its impact in the creation of value (Capaldo, 2007; Dell’Era and Verganti, 2007 and 2010). Design Thinking, in particular, is making the headlines, with rapid diffusion in practice . Far from being solely about the “form” of products, Design Thinking is accepted as a formal method for creative problem solving, with the intent to foster innovation (Brown, 2009; Martin, 2009; Liedtka, 2015). Accenture, Deloitte, IBM, KPMG, McKinsey and PricewaterhouseCoopers rank among the most active players in acquiring design agencies in order to renew their offerings and refresh their approach. Contemporary Design Thinking is booming in those industries where digital transformation requires new competences and capabilities for developing delightful digital experiences (Calabretta and Kleinsmann, 2017). However, the rapid adoption of Design Thinking in practice has not gone hand-in-hand with a robust development and diffusion of its theoretical underpinnings. On the one hand Design Thinking describes significant transformations highlighting overlaps and synergies with emerging approaches such Design Sprint (Knapp et al., 2016), Agile (Bianchi et al., 2018) or Creative Confidence (Kelley and Kelley, 2010); on the other hand, it is considered a fundamental paradigm to lead digital transformations (Leavy, 2008).
This research uses data collected using a survey that investigates the complex relationships between Design Thinking practices and the value generated. In other words, what are the practices underpinning the generation of value from the adoption of different types of Design Thinking. The collected data are about consulting projects based on Design Thinking and completed in 2018 by European leading consulting firms. The survey is based on different sections and items that have been identified by leveraging both the literature constructs and the iteration performed with managers. Specifically we collected the following data about each consulting project:
 Organizational Setting: team size and configuration considering both the consultant and the client side;
 Goals: objectives addressed by the consulting project;
 Context: context influencing the consulting project;
 Practices: practices adopted during the consulting project;
 Value: value generated by the consulting project considering both the consultant and the client side.
The results show that Design Thinking practices vary significantly depending on the influence provided by the organizational setting, addressed goals and context. This research contributes to both theory and practice by shedding light on the effectiveness of different types of Design Thinking practices and the value generated. This contributes to the existing debate on the Design Thinking practices (Beverland et al., 2015) and perspectives (Micheli et al, 2018). Furthermore, it contributes to the debate among practitioners by showing the value that different practices can generate in consulting projects driven by Design Thinking.","Beverland, M. B., S. J. S.

"MAGISTRETTI, STEFANO ","DELL'ERA, CLAUDIO ",,,,,,EMPOWERING DESIGN THINKING WITH DIGITAL TECHNOLOGIES,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Technologies are spread in the world, and with the advent of the digital world, their
presence in our daily life is booming (Nambisan et al., 2017). In the last decades,
several different digital technologies are changing the way people live, and the way
the company develops new products and services. Indeed, digital technologies such
as Artificial Intelligence, Big Data and Blockchain are just a few of the innovations
that are disrupting the society (Williams and Edge, 1996). This is happening at both
the society and corporate level. As a matter of fact, companies not only are
struggling in understanding how can digital technologies be adequately developed in
order to be adopted and accepted by the humans but they are also fighting in
comprehending the potentiality that digital technologies can bring to the innovation
processes (Dell’Era et al, 2017; Dannells and Frattini, 2018).
In particular, the paper focuses on this second avenue of research. In particular, it
considers not all innovation processes but the one that positions the human at the
center (Beckman and Barry, 2007; Brown, 2008). Indeed, academics and practitioners
are giving to these approaches growing attention (Verganti, 2017; Micheli et al.,
2018). Different systematic literature reviews on the topic are emerging
(Johansson-Sköldberg et al., 2013; Liedtka, 2015; Cettindamar, 2017; CMR, 2018). All of
them are aiming at understanding more about design thinking and its power for the
innovation processes. What they are not focusing on adequately, as far as the author
knowledge, is the role that digital technologies can have in the design thinking
projects.
Accordingly, the paper aims at answering the following research question: how can
companies integrate fruitfully digital technologies in design thinking projects. So, the
case study methodology appears to be the most appropriate approach in order to
explore the research mentioned above problem because it is particularly indicated to
answer to ""how"" questions and to investigate complex phenomena (Yin, 2011).
Indeed, considering the multifaceted aspect of this topic, an exploratory case study
research can help in shedding light on it. In particular, we adopted a literal replication
of cases of companies adopting digital technologies in managing and developing
design thinking projects. In other words, the focus of the research is to investigate
first which are the digital technologies that can be adopted in this particular kind of
innovation processes. Second is to understand in which moments of the process they
are useful and finally to comprehend how these technologies can be integrated into
the projects. Leveraging ten real design thinking projects that were performed
during the last two years the paper provides evidence on how different digital
technologies can transform the design thinking processes.
The results of the analysis show that digital technologies are of first help in the front
end of the design thinking process where the market usually is unknown, and the
technology such as data mining and big data analytics can help managers and
practitioners in knowing more the future adopters. Moreover, it shows how
creativity can be boosted through the adoption of digital technologies. For example,
Artificial Intelligence technologies such as Chef Watson are an example of how AI can
support the creativity by proposing different combinations of ingredients by
analyzing tons of data in a matter second. Finally, the paper proposes a series of
hypothesis that emerges from the integration of the digital evidence with the
process of design thinking. This is of primary interest of both academics and
practitioners due to the value that the contributions propose to the two
communities. On the one hand, it sheds light on the ongoing debate of the digital
technology streams of literature (Micheli et al., 2018) by showing how they can also
contribute to a new way of managing innovations (Knapp et al., 2017; Natalicchio et
al., 2017). On the other hand, it provides managers with insights on how to adopt
digital technologies in the process from a practical perspective.","Beckman, S. L., & Barry, M. (2007). Innovation as a learning process: Embedding design

"DI MARCO, DILETTA ","PELLIZZONI, ELENA ","VERGANTI, ROBERTO","BUGANZA, TOMMASO",,,,ENGAGEMENT IN INNOVATION: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"For a long time, innovation was confined to R&D departments where people had to
innovate as a job. Nowadays, several drivers are moving innovation off the hands of
innovation professionals: servitization, digitalization, open innovation, intrapreneurship,
all imply that innovation happens in any area of organizations, and therefore concerns
everyone. It, therefore, becomes necessary to find drivers that motivate internal and
external stakeholders to actively participate in change and innovation activities (e.g.
Lakhani and Von Hippel, 2003; Füller et al., 2010).
The challenge is no more to simply to engage people in generating ideas. We indeed live
in a world that is awash with ideas, overcrowded by an unprecedented amount of novel
opportunities (Verganti, 2016). Thus, it becomes fundamental not only to motivate
people in the release of this flow of ideas but also to engage them in the formulation of
a common direction and then into the course of action and implementation. In this way,
to engage people in innovation acquires a more comprehensive meaning.
Originally, the concept of engagement has been examined in the domains of
organizational psychology by Kahn (1990) who has formally defined employee
engagement as “the harnessing of organization members’ selves to their work roles and
performance”.
Since then, researchers have conducted several studies on engagement and highlighted
that, when engaged, individuals should be attentive, emotionally connected and fully
concentrated on their job. Moreover, they release tremendous energy and motivation
toward a shared purpose and foster an organization’s capacity to thrive. (Kahn, 1990;
May et al., 2004; Rich et al.,2010; Groyberg, 2018). Previous researches mainly focused
on developing the psychometric properties of several antecedents (Bailey, 2017) and on
understanding management practices or to learn what organizations can do to better
motivate employees (Wefald & Downey, 2009; Macey 2009; Martinez 2015).
Nevertheless, it has recently been acknowledged that engagement is under-theorized
and needs further theoretical development both in terms of definition and
operationalization (Bakker et al. 2011). Most of what we know about engagement in
innovation comes from a plethora of perspectives from diverse branches of knowledge
such as psychology, human resources, public policy and marketing (Saks, 2006). Our
paper contributes by providing a new framework of engagement from an innovation
management perspective, proving its distinctiveness from other well-established
definitions.
In order to answer the research question “how engagement can be addressed from an
innovation management perspective?” a systematic review is performed (Cook, Mulrow
and Haynes, 1997). Publications were identified through Scopus using the basic
keywords (“engagement”), (“engage*” AND “innovation”) with specific filters.
Accordingly, a limited amount of peer-reviewed journals with ABS (3,4,4*) was chosen in
order to consider validated knowledge with the highest likelihood to have an impact in
these fields (Podsakoff et al., 2005). Co-citation analysis was implemented as an
indicator of the affinity across publications. Finally, to provide a more in depth
knowledge, content analysis of the focal articles was also conducted (Randhawa et al.,
2016).
This paper allows to identify a three-fold research agenda which contributes to
innovation management literature: i) categorizing the several engagement models
suggested by previous literature, ii) proposing a comprehensive definition of
engagement and of its operationalization and iii) presenting a robust framework and
holistic understanding of engagement from an innovation management perspective.
From a managerial point of view our findings offer managers and policymakers useful
insights on how to engage people in innovation in order to move them to a meaningful
common direction.","Bailey, C., Madden, A., Alfes, K. and Fletcher, L. (2015). The meaning, antecedents and

"DINC, YUSUF ",,,,,,,PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IN ISLAMIC FINANCE AND BANKING IN SECULAR ECONOMIES,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"While the global paradigm in economics is shifting, Islamic economics began to attract attentions as an alternative. Most common and the strongest institutional structure of Islamic economics appears with Islamic finance and banking. In many economies Islamic banking and finance is in the centre of innovation in recent years. Product development is one of the most important factor driving Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) success or failure. Product development of IFIs is also key for overall economic performance likewise other financial institutions. However there is a gap in the literature to suggest a methodology for the product development process of IFIs. Product development is a complex process, and it is likely that introducing a certain model will be useful for expanding activities of IFIs. This study suggests a methodology for the product development process of IFIs in secular economies where many operates in. The first chapter defines product development for IFIs to show the importance in increasing performance through literature investigation. The second chapter evaluates the current product development process models for IFIs. Product development process models for conventional banks also analysed in this part for a final comparison. The suggested product development model is defined in the last chapter with the following aspects discussed in order to contribute to the understanding of the product development process in a secular economy for IFI: the perceived benefits of secular arbitrage in the new product development process, the disadvantages of secular economic environment for Sharia’h compliant product development, the effect of secular regulations on the new product development process of IFIs, and the factors that increase the likelihood of a successful Sharia’h compliant product development.
This study is a first attempt for modelling product development in IFIs under secular economies. Advances in the field of Sharia’h compliant product development is important for researchers and professional.","Ahmed, H. (2011). Product development in Islamic banks.

"DRESSEN, SEBASTIAN",,,,,,,INDICATORS FOR MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT IN A UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COLLABORATION – THE INDUSTRIAL PERSPECTIVE,15 - Open Innovation,"Environments with frequently and rapidly changing technologies push firms to innovate in order to sustain their performance (Akman and Yilmaz, 2008). Open innovation allows knowledge to enter and exit the firm and therefore improve the access to innovation (Chesbrough 2003; Chesbrough and Crowther 2006; Enkel et al. 2009). The field of university-industry collaboration (UIC) is one promising tool for enhancing organizational capacity (Dess and Shaw, 2001), a complementary option to traditional internal R&D (Harvey and Tether, 2003). Thereby, the definition of success of the interaction and its outcomes may vary between the actors (Barnes et al., 2002). Ankrah & AL-Tabbaa (2015) described the need for more objective measures to investigate the effectiveness of UIC and how UIC can replace or at least contribute to the R&D capabilities of a firm. Albats et al. (2018) identified first universal key performance indicators for the UIC lifecycle stages inputs, in-process activities, outputs and impacts by taking in account existing studies (Perkmann et al. 2011; Piva and Rossi-Lamastra 2013; Rossi and Rosli 2015; Seppo and Lilles 2012) and analysing multiple case studies. This research provides with a long-term study additional insight of UIC mechanisms on the firm level and helps assessing the ‘value’ of outcomes of these relationships for manufacturing technologies.
2. APPROACH AND RESEARCH MODEL
We have empirically studied over two years a UIC between a German university and German large high-tech firm. We interviewed five PhD students, responsible for manufacturing technology R&D projects, four times in this period. All projects are executed in an identical collaboration framework. The focus of the research is to identify the UIC impact on the research, development and implementation procedures of manufacturing technologies in an industrial perspective. To generate the outcome, semi-structured interviews were executed, coded, and detailed indicators for each project abstracted and allocated to the UIC lifecycle of Perkmann et al. (2011). Furthermore,
quantitative data of the firm as milestones, budgets, man-hours etc. of these projects are compared with data of traditional R&D projects to confirm the previous findings of UIC mechanisms for manufacturing technologies with objective measures.
3. CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD AND MANAGERIAL IMPLICATIONS
Due to the intense collaboration in the UIC framework, the technology maturity level was significantly increased in the two years. Several mechanisms had to be in place during the development process to keep the progress and to justify the efforts and expenses of the activity inside the firm. The study describes these mechanisms over the UIC lifecycle and clearly illustrates with indicators the impact of UIC on the research, development and implementation of the manufacturing technologies on the micro level. The progress of the technologies is directly linked with indicators like innovativeness, roles, workload, know-how, technology and resource availability, network, benefits etc. The study gives insights into the mechanisms of UIC and its indicators. It will provide practitioners know-how to setup UIC initiatives for manufacturing technologies to increase the innovation funnel of the firm and sustain competitive advantages.","Akman, G. and Yilmaz, C.

LEVERAGING THE SALESFORCE TO DEVELOP CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: SALESPERSON AND CUSTOMER CHARACTERISTICS TO CONSIDER”,16 - Organising New Product Development,"Objectives, theoretical and practical relevance
Products which don’t meet customer needs fail. Thus, firms are well advised to
develop customer knowledge to better address those needs. Customer knowledge
development (CKD) conceptualizes how customer knowledge is generated through
an ongoing probing and learning process with customers (Joshi and Sharma, 2004).
2
The salesforce can play an important role in this process (Kuester et al., 2017; Malshe
and Biemans, 2014). This is because salespeople understand the customer’s
organization and tend to be well networked within its structures. Our study aims to
contribute to the NPD and sales literature in three ways (de Jong et al., 2014). First, it
examines the customer involvement in NPD through the salesforce by looking at the
mediating role of customer segment diversity in the relationship between CKD and
NPD success. Second, building on the notion that not all customers are alike, it
investigates different characteristics of customers and their role in driving CKD.
Finally, by doing so, the study extends the understanding of drivers of CKD beyond
the organizational context (Joshi and Sharma, 2004)
2. Brief literature mapping and references
The role of the sales department as a distinct contributor to the NPD process has
received some research interest before, especially from the perspective of sales
acting as a provider of superior market intelligence (Kuester and Rauch, 2016;
Rochford and Wotruba, 1993). Their role as facilitators of customer knowledge
gained through customer involvement has, on the contrary, been of much less
interest (Ernst et al., 2010). We consider this a major shortcoming due to two
reasons. First, CKD drives NPD success (Joshi and Sharma, 2004). Second, sales is
closely linked to customers thus in the best position to involve and select them for
NPD (Gordon at el., 2007; Griffin and Hauser, 1993).
3. Research questions and model
Figure 1 depicts our research framework:
- Please insert figure 1 about here -
Specifically, we examine the following hypotheses:
H1: The more customer knowledge is developed within NPD projects, the more
successful they will be once launched in the market.
H2: The more customer knowledge is developed within NPD projects, the more
diverse are customers that are involved by sales in NPD.
H3: The higher the diversity of customers involved, the higher the NPD project
success.
H4: The more customer oriented the involved salespeople are, the higher the level of
CKD within the NPD project.
H5: The more cognitive empathy the involved salespeople possess, the higher the
level of CKD within the NPD project.
3
H6: The more technical knowledge the involved salespeople possess, the higher the
level of CKD within the NPD project.
4. Data/Method
We conducted a survey at the NPD project level in five German industries. We
obtained questionnaires on 97 NPD projects. Our measurement scales were a mix of
existing and newly developed ones, both reflective and formative in nature. We used
PLS-SEM (Ringle et al., 2015) to test our hypotheses.
5. Findings
The results show that CKD directly and indirectly drives NPD project success.
Specifically, customer segment diversity mediates the relationship between CKD and
NPD project success. This supports the notion that it’s beneficial to involve
customers not only with economic potential but also based on their informational
capabilities, opinion leadership and quality of company relationship. Furthermore,
our data shows that CKD is driven by characteristics of individual sales people
involved in the knowledge generation process. Especially, characteristics such as
customer orientation, cognitive empathy, and technical knowledge help to increase
CKD.
6. Conclusion and contribution to the field
The findings suggest that CKD is key for NPD success at the project level. Personal
characteristics of salespeople are important to shape CKD. These findings both
enhance existing research on the role of sales in NPD as well as provide practical
guidance for companies on how to organize and staff NPD projects.","de Jong, Ad, Verbeke, Willem and Nijssen, Ed (2014). Introduction to special issue:","Brown, T. (2008). Design thinking.

"EBBING, TOBIAS ","LÜTHJE, CHRISTIAN",,,,,,PRICING BEHAVIOR OF CONSUMER INNOVATORS,"11 - Marketing, Markets and Users of Innovations","This research compares the price setting behavior of household sector (HHS) innovators and
commercial firms by the example of computer games.
Innovation research has hardly investigated issues related with the commercialization of HHSInnovation.
This has three reasons: (1) HHS-Developers have been found to innovate primarily for
use benefits. Reaping such benefits usually does not require diffusion (de Jong et al., 2015; 2018).
(2) it was at least costly for HHS-Developers to popularize their achievements as they lacked access
to broader communication channels. (3) Once selling, they switch their functional role and leave the
scope of user innovation research.
With the emergence of low-cost sales channels, such as virtual marketplaces, HHS-Innovators
increasingly enter and influence markets (Shah,Tripsas 2012). Their non-commercial origins may
impact the commercialization activities down the road. Research in this field hence is of high
relevance. One key area of commercialization is pricing. Three factors are commonly identified as
most influential in industrial price setting: Costs, customer value and competition. We hypothesize
that innovating consumers respond differently than commercials to those:
H1 Innovating consumers set lower prices than commercial firms for similar products: This
builds on the empirical insights that user innovators have higher interest in generating positive impact
than in securing innovation rents (Franke, Shah 2003). Household innovators are also expected to
perceive low prices as instrumental for better adoption rates.
H2 Innovating consumers align prices closer to the buyer’s perceived value than commercial
firms: Consumer innovators are expected to exceed in making valid predictions of the perceived
value of their products. As they are usually heavily involved in the use of products, they possess free
access to sticky knowledge about what consumers value. We expect them to also have an interest in
setting fair prices to their peers.
H3 Innovating consumers relate their prices less strongly to the development effort than
commercial firms: While cost-plus pricing is a dominant logic to set minimum prices, consumer
developers often do not have the pressure to compensate their development effort. Also, HHSInnovators
benefit from use, learning, fun, attention or altruism (Hippel 2005, 2017), so that the
process itself rewards HHS-Developers.
H4 Innovating consumers orient prices more strongly towards competitors’ prices than
commercial firms: As they are less experienced in pricing, they are prone to choose prices charged
for similar products as reference and have a higher inclination to use such easily acquirable heuristics.
We gathered information on ~15,000 computer games from various sites to test the hypotheses in
OLS-Regression. Based on this, hypotheses 1 - 3 were confirmed. Hypothesis 4 shows multimodality
(‘sticky’ price points) and was confirmed outside the regression model.
This study contributes to HHS-Innovation research (OECD, 2018) by shifting focus from the creation
of innovations to their exploitation. It contributes to pricing research by testing well-established price
determinants in the field of HHS-Innovations. Overall it gives understanding of price dynamics in
markets that are increasingly characterized by an interplay of the HHS and professionals.","de Jong, Gillert & Stock (2018). First adoption of consumer innovations: Exploring market failure and

"ENDRES, HERBERT ","HELM, ROLAND","DOWLING, MICHAEL",,,,,SENSING IN ACTION: HOW FORMAL EXTERNAL KNOWLEDGE SOURCES AFFECT SENSING UNDER DIFFERENT DYNAMIC ENVIRONMENTS,20 - Theory Development in Innovation Research,"Digital technologies are increasingly changing firms’ business environments. Researchers
have used the concept “dynamic capabilities” for sustainable competitiveness through
handling changes in this fast-changing world (Helfat and Peteraf, 2009; Schilke, 2014;
Teece, 2007; Teece, 2018; Teece et al., 2016). In this study, we focus on the dynamic
capability “sensing” or sensing capability. This capability to recognize market
opportunities and threats is key to a firm’s continuous change and renewal (Protogerou et
al., 2012; Teece, 2007).
Although research has progressed in recent years, the dynamic capabilities concept still
lacks clarity, particularly regarding the understanding of the dimensions (Di Stefano et
al., 2014; Eriksson, 2014; Li and Liu, 2014; Schilke et al., 2017). Empirical research also
has mainly examined this concept on the surface by focusing on effects on the overall
framework and has hardly investigated specific dimensions (Von den Driesch et al.,
2015; Yi et al., 2015). Both issues hamper development of the construct and its practical
use for a firm’s management, and lessen the construct’s potential to make a substantive
impact on strategic management (Di Stefano et al., 2014).
Thus, what can managers do to adapt to market changes, such as digital transformation or
new competition, and sustain their firm’s competitiveness? To answer this question, we
develop a theoretical framework linking formal external knowledge sourcing with a
firm’s sensing capability under different dynamic environments.
Apart from the general research gap of poorly specified and non-actionable dimensions of
dynamic capabilities, previous research related to the sensing capability has at least two
further major limitations. First, some researchers focused on the role of external
knowledge sources only in the process of recognizing opportunities (Kirca et al., 2005;
Laursen and Salter, 2006; Matsuno et al., 2000; Shane, 2000). Thus, these studies did not
address the whole concept of the sensing capability described by Teece (2007), which
also includes the recognition of threats.
Second, studies in this field did not compare the effects of different external knowledge
sourcings with each other (e.g., Foss et al., 2013; Laursen and Salter, 2006; Nag and
Gioia, 2012; Shane, 2000). Thus, a prioritization of formal external knowledge sources
for sensing market opportunities and threats might be difficult to derive from these
studies.
Against this background, our study provides two major contributions. First, we derive
and examine the key formal external knowledge sourcing determinants of the sensing
capability. Therefore, we not only make one dimension of dynamic capabilities more
tangible and thus, more useful for managers but also extend external knowledge sourcing
literature. We expect firms with a developed sensing capability to be more likely to use
customers, market partners, and research institutions and to be less likely to use
competition. The findings reveal that the hypothesized key formal external knowledge
sources significantly determine the sensing capability of firms but to a different extent.
Second, as suggested by researchers, in this study we include the moderating variable of
environmental dynamism (Danneels, 2008; Drnevich and Kriauciunas, 2011; Helfat et al.,
2007). Surprisingly, the results suggest that the same formal external knowledge sourcing
has a different impact on the sensing capability depending on the firm’s environmental
dynamism.
To obtain these results, we analyzed questionnaire data from top managers at 483 firms
by the use of structural equation modeling. We confirmed the validity of our study with a
second respondent sample, and objective firm data.",,"Brown, T. (2009). Change by design. How Design Thinking transforms organizations and

"ENDRES, HERBERT ","HÜSIG, STEFAN",,,,,,WHO IS IN THE DRIVER SEAT OF THE DIGITAL INNOVATION PROCESS? THE ROLE OF CHAMPIONS IN DRIVING THE USAGE OF INNOVATION MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE,08 - Managing Knowledge and Information Systems in New Product Development,"In the context of digitalization, the use of digital technology triggers the creation of or
changes to products, processes, or business models (Nambisan et al. 2017). Previous
research has highlighted the digitization of innovation processes and outcomes, especially
with regard to the impact of information technology (IT) on new product development
(NPD) (Durmuşoğlu and Barczak 2011; Heim et al. 2012; Kawakami et al. 2014;
Mauerhoefer et al. 2017). Durmusoğlu (2009) suggested that the IT infrastructure
capability could enhance NPD process efficiency by reducing the cycle time and cost of
NPD projects and by improving the NPD process quality. Scholars such as Heim et al.
(2012), Durmuşoğlu and Barczak (2011), and Mauerhoefer et al. (2017) tested such
propositions, and reported positive impacts on NPD outcomes.
Typically, these studies deal on the one hand with how these tools can influence and
improve the innovation process (Durmuşoğlu and Barczak 2011; Mauerhoefer et al.
2017; Kroh et al. 2018). On the other hand, they cite various influencing factors on the
use of the tools. These factors also include an ""executive champion"", who has a
significant influence on the use of NPD related IT tools (Barczak et al. 2007; Kawakami
et al. 2015; Mauerhoefer et al. 2017). An executive champion refers to “a senior member
of the company with the power and authority to support a project” (Schilling and Hill,
1998, p. 74).
Nevertheless, the empirical research so far has largely failed to investigate the influence
of specific (executive) champions on the usage of software for the NPD process (e.g.,
Kawakami et al. 2015; Mauerhoefer et al. 2017). Further, these studies missed to address
different promoter roles that might be also relevant in supporting innovation decisions
such as the usage of IT technologies in the innovation process (Hauschildt and
Kirchmann 2002). Such studies, however, will only be of limited benefit to those who are
in charge of the NPD process, such as innovation mangers, chief technology officers
(CTO) or chief executive officers (CEO) due to their generic results. It is important for
managers to know which champions drive the usage of IT tools for the NPD process and
not just that executive champions do so in general. Therefore, more detailed knowledge is
needed about how they can serve as levers for improving the usage of IT tools in the
NPD process in order to increase NPD performance metrics.
In this paper, we explore various champions influencing the usage frequency of a specific
class of software tools to support innovation management methods and activities, which
is called Innovation Management Software (IMS). IMS tries to emphasize the innovation
management aspects in the innovation process that were previously often classified as
Computer Aided Innovation tools (Huesig and Endres 2018; Huesig and Kohn 2009). We
used an online questionnaire and gathered data from innovation managers of 165 German
industrial firms to explore which champion(s) influence(s) the usage frequency of IMS.
Wherever possible, we validated this information with objective data such as website
information and business reports. We analyzed the data by using OLS regressions.
Our results indicate that in contrast to the previous assumptions in the literature, not
every champion increases IMS usage. While champions such as CEOs and innovation
managers positively influence the usage of IMS tools, IT managers and development
managers can even reduce IMS usage frequency. Therefore, firms should have a
differentiated view by choosing champions to optimize the successful IMS usage in their
NPD process. This is particularly important in the context of digitalization where
conflicting power constellations between traditional IT and innovation roles seem to
exist.","Hauschildt, J., and Kirchmann, E. (2001): Teamwork for innovation – the `troika' of

"ENGWALL, MATS","STRÖMSTEN, TORKEL",,,,,,HOW MANAGEMENT ACCOUNTING KILLS SUSTAINABLE INNOVATION,10 - Managing Sustainability in Innovation and Product Development,"Organizations need to balance their established products and technologies with an R&D
portfolio of new products and services, and potentially also new underlying technologies.
Previous literature deals with this issue as a challenge of balancing exploitation and
exploration (March 1991) and how organizations should be structured to be ambidextrous
(Tushman and O’Reilly 1996), i.e. to be able to simultaneously handle incremental and
radical innovation.
Based on an in-depth case study of a a globally leading automotive company producing
heavy duty vehicles, such as trucks and buses, this paper addresses the intersection
between innovation strategy and management control. It explores how management
accounting practices pushes R&D efforts from highly needed radical innovation, towards
exploitation of already existing knowledge.
There is a consensus among experts that the internal combustion engine technology in
15-20 years, will no longer be viable. Climate change, sustainability concerns, and public
policies drives the whole transportation industry towards zero emission solutions.
However, in spite of growing top management concerns about these issues, an
overwhelming majority of the company’s R&D investments are still directed towards
products based on the internal combustion engine (diesel engine) technology.
This paper illustrates how the management accounting and accounting calculations
techniques play a critical role in hindering innovation and commercialization of
alternative technologies to take place. For example; innovation in the traditional diesel
technology is supported by a set of performance indicators that when applied on an
alternative technology, work against these more radical technological innovations.
The company is applying “target costing” as a technique to guide development projects
for both existing platform products, as well as radical product development projects.
According to this technique, if a proposed project is calculated to become too expensive
for an existing customer segment it will be terminated. In the paper it is shown how the
use of target costing effectively favors product development in line with the existing
diesel platform and suffocates attempts to develop alternative technologies and products.
The study is based upon 39 interviews; 24 at the case company and 15 with actors in the
surrounding sector, e.g. suppliers, customers, and regulatory actors. Furthermore we had
access to internal documentation, such as management reports as well as public
information, such as annual and quarterly reports.
The paper contributes to the literature on innovation strategy by revealing how
accounting and finance-related metrics represent important mechanisms behind decisions
not to invest in new technology. By doing this it builds on ideas on “innovation killers”
(Christensen et al 2008) and accounting calculations as mediating instruments (Christner
and Strömsten 2015) in innovation endeavors. Thus, accounting calculations shape
innovation and influence R&D portfolios, the organizational arrangement, and its
timeliness.
The paper will guide managers to develop more effective control systems for the balance
of current and future demands. One implication point is the direction of the dangers of
existing management control systems and calculations. Existing calculations are adapted
to support development of existing products and services. New measures or allowing new
interpretations of existing measures and calculations are needed in order allow for new
and radical products and services to emerge.",,"Bojovic, N., Genet, C., and Sabatier, V. (2018). Learning, signaling, and convincing: The role of

Creativity in New Product Development,"Recent studies have demonstrated that hybrid structures in brainstorming – involving a variation in nominal and interactive phases – lead to better results in terms of idea generation. However, one of the major challenges in brainstorming literature remains the management of the well-known tradeoff between novelty and usefulness when generating, and selecting creative ideas. In the present paper, we examine the impact of task instructions provided to groups in hybrid brainstorming on the quantity, quality and discernment of generated ideas. We performed an experiment on 126 undergraduate students, in which we alternated between novelty and usefulness goals across nominal and interactive phases. Results suggest that i) groups that started with novelty goals were better at generating more ideas, and ideas with high novelty scores at the expense of feasibility, whereas ii) groups that started with usefulness goals first were better at generating ideas with high feasibility scores at the expense of novelty, and were better at discerning the quality of ideas. Our results extends previous findings on the role of anchoring bias on group creativity, and provide implications for theory and research on group creativity and the effects of task instructions in hybrid brainstorming.",,"Stilgoe, J., Owen, R., & McNaghten, P.

"FISCHENICH, SABRINA ","TALKE, KATRIN",,,,,,KNOW YOUR BRAND’S DESIGN DNA INTRODUCTION OF A PROFILING SCHEME TO CAPTURE THE AESTHETIC ATTRIBUTES AND SYMBOLIC ASSOCIATIONS OF INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIOS OVER TIME,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"A brand’s design DNA, understood as a distinct visual design language that is shaping a
brand’s products over time, is an important means of differentiation (Montaña et al.,
2007). Porsche is an often cited example of a brand with a unique design DNA (e.g.,
Chen, 2018). Porsche models can be identified immediately due to a set of shared
aesthetic attributes: air inlets in the front, pronounced fenders and shoulders, and the
flyline silhouette (Mauer, 2018). These aesthetic attributes evoke symbolic associations -
all Porsche cars appear dynamic, powerful, and elegant (Zec, 2012). Indeed, Michael
Mauer (2018), Director Style Porsche, emphasizes that the distinctiveness of Porsche’s
design DNA results from maintaining and carefully developing core design elements.
A thorough understanding of a brand’s design DNA is thus crucial for managing the
brand’s design language across the product portfolio and for developing new designs,
which are still firmly rooted in the brand’s design history. However, the relevant
literature neither provides a clear definition of the construct “design DNA” nor a tool for
its holistic assessment. With this article we therefore aim at contributing to design theory
and management by providing 1) a clear definition of a brand’s design DNA, 2) a
comprehensive profiling scheme for assessing the aesthetic attributes and symbolic
associations characteristic of a brand, and 3) a procedure for applying that scheme.
For the definition of a brand’s design DNA we stress two aspects 1) its long-term nature
(e.g., Karjalainen & Snelders, 2010) and 2) its two-dimensionality (e.g., Ashby, 2014). In
that sense, a brand’s design DNA expresses the core aesthetic attributes and symbolic
associations shared by the products of a brand portfolio over time. Since the 1950s, the
products of Braun, for example, are known for their symmetric, geometric forms, lack of
décor, and muted colors, which express clarity, purity and simplicity.
To develop a comprehensive profiling scheme of a brand’s design DNA, we reviewed
existing scales that either measure aesthetic attributes (e.g., Chen & Owen, 1997) or
symbolic associations (e.g., Hsu et al., 2000) of products. After deriving two pools of
items from theses scales, we used several review rounds with design experts to identify
redundancies and inaccurate attributions within and across each item pool, to review the
items’ ability for characterizing products across different consumer goods categories, and
to evaluate the resulting scales’ comprehensiveness. Finally, we asked a different group
of design experts to profile iconic products of eight contrasting design movements of the
postwar era (e.g., neo-functionalism, postmodernism, pop). The results of a cluster
analysis confirm the discriminative ability of our profiling scheme.
When applying the profiling scheme for the assessment of a brand’s design DNA,
managers have to start at the product level and first identify the aesthetic attributes and
symbolic associations of each individual product. Then, turning to the portfolio level,
they can detect which attributes and associations are shared by all products, thus, a
brand’s design language. By repeating this evaluation for the past years, designers can
trace the historic development of a brand’s design language, thereby pinpointing the heart
of the brand’s design DNA – or the lack of it.","ASHBY, M. F. & JOHNSON, K. 2014. Materials and design: The art and science of

"FRANZO', SIMONE","FRATTINI, FEDERICO","URBINATI, ANDREA","MANFREDI LATILLA, VITO",,,,INVESTIGATING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN ORGANISATIONAL CULTURE AND THE ADOPTION OF OPEN INNOVATION: A PROJECT-LEVEL CASES STUDY ANALYSIS IN THE ENERGY EFFICIENCY INDUSTRY,15 - Open Innovation,"The present paper aims to understand how organisational culture influences
the adoption of open innovation in firms that implement energy efficiency projects.
A small number of studies on this topic (e.g., West and Bogers, 2014; Bader et
al., 2014, Herzog and Leker, 2010) – despite not directly related to energy efficiency -
state that both the degree of openness to external collaborations of a firm’s
innovation process and the results of these collaborative initiatives depend on the
firm’s organisational culture. However, they focus on a limited number of
organisational culture’s dimensions and do not approach them in systemic and
holistic way.
The topic is becoming particularly interesting into the energy efficiency
industry. Indeed, a preliminary analysis on the modus operandi of firms implementing
energy efficiency projects shows that they adopt the open innovation principles
through establishing partnerships with third parties during the development of their
projects. However, the propensity of firms implementing energy efficiency projects
following a (open) collaborative approach is quite heterogeneous. Therefore, the
absent or incorrect understanding of the role of organisational culture for the open
innovation adoption in firms implementing energy efficiency projects could likely
hamper a wider diffusion of energy efficiency projects, which – by their nature and
idiosyncratic characteristics – call firms for having a strong collaborative connotation.
In the light of the above premises, the main research questions we aim to
answer with the paper are: how do the characteristics of organizational culture
influence the degree of openness of firms implementing energy efficiency projects? How
do these dimensions influence the results of such collaboratively implemented projects?
The paper relies on a multiple project-based cases analysis (Eisenhardt, 1989;
Yin, 2003). As that shows how organizational culture of a firm implementing energy
efficiency projects influences its degree of openness towards external parties, which
in turn affects the success of such collaboratively implemented projects. In particular,
the paper highlights the cultural dimensions that positively influence the willingness
of firms implementing energy efficiency projects to involve external parties: (a) the
propensity of firms to use external technologies, (b) the risk-taking propensity, (c)
the orientation to technological innovation and (d) the presence of rituals for
rewarding employees who have excelled in collaborative activities. Second, other
cultural dimensions positively influence the results of collaborative energy efficiency
projects, i.e., (e) the simultaneous presence of language that tends towards the
habits and communication style of players with whom the firm collaborates in
implementing energy efficiency projects and (f) an inclusive physical and virtual
environment.
This work adds to the literature on organizational issues, which not only
represent the antecedents of open innovation but also moderate the impact of open
innovation on firms’ performance, by showing organizational culture dimensions on
which firms can leverage to implement in a collaborative way and with success
energy efficiency projects. Second, the research provides several insights for top and
middle managers of energy efficiency companies willing to promote the adoption of
open innovation in their firms. In particular, the results allow managers to recognize
organisational culture domains according to which they can make decisions to enable
the propensity of firms to adopt open innovation and maximize the results of such
initiatives.","Bader, K., Vanbrabant, L. and Enkel, E. (2014). Drivers of firm openness: Innovation

"FREISINGER, ELENA","HEIDENREICH, SVEN","SPIETH, PATRICK",,,,,THE DARK SIDE OF BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION - INVESTIGATING DETERMINANTS AND STRATEGIES TO OVERCOME BMI RESISTANCE,03 - Emerging and Early Research (Young Scholars Track),"One of the most prominent statements in business model innovation (BMI) research is the widely stated beneficial effect of BMI on organizational performance (Foss & Saebi, 2017) and a considerable literature has grown up around this theme (e.g. Gerasymenko et al., 2015; Kim & Min, 2015; Visnjic et al., 2016; Zott & Amit, 2007). Extant research further acknowledges that consumer acceptance of BMI is a prerequisite of its success (Markides, 2006; Sousa-Zomer & Cauchick, 2016), but surprisingly very little attention has been paid to factors that inhibit or facilitate its adoption and diffusion in the market. Studies in the adjacent field of innovation management research report that more than 50% of all (product) innovations ultimately fail (Castellion & Markham, 2013) and that passive innovation resistance (PIR) may be a possible cause for that (Heidenreich & Handrich, 2015; Talke & Heidenreich, 2014). It has also been noted that countermeasures as specific marketing instruments have the potential to mitigate consumers’ resistance towards innovation (Goode, Dahl, & Moreau, 2013; Heidenreich & Handrich, 2015; Heidenreich & Kraemer, 2016; Zhao, Hoeffler, & Dahl, 2012). So far, however, there has been no discussion about the role of BMI in innovation adoption research. Therefore, the proposed paper addresses this gap by applying two distinct studies each using a scenario-based experimental design. The first study strives to answer the following research question: How and under which circumstances is passive innovation resistance met with business model innovation? The second study addresses the question: What are effective strategies to overcome passive innovation resistance in the light of business model innovation? Our contribution to literature is threefold: We investigate (1) the effects of different levels of BMI on a consumer centric dependent variable, assess (2) how passive innovation resistance affects consumers’ adoption in light of BMI and, examine (3) the effectiveness of marketing instruments to overcome consumers’ resistance towards BMI.
Method
In order to examine the proposed hypotheses, we conducted two scenario-based experiments with consumers (n1=643, n2=439). We focused on the food retail industry, more specifically on a supermarket-scenario, in which we introduced
different types of BMI (study 1) and combined them with marketing instruments, such as analogy, mental simulation, and benefit comparison (study 2). The dependent variable of interest, purchase intention, was measured using a seven-point Likert scale adapted from Heitmann, Lehmann, and Herrmann (2007). The independent variable, PIR, was measured using a third-order hierarchical constructed adapted from Heidenreich and Handrich (2015).
Preliminary results
Preliminary data analysis so far shows that the valence of the BMI effect depends on the level of PIR of the consumers. Figure 1 depicts a statistically significant interaction between BMI and level of passive innovation resistance for purchase intention F(1,497) = 6.297, p = 0.012.
Figure 1 Effect on Purchase Intention
Further preliminary findings allow the following interpretations. The magnitude of the positive BMI effect in case of low PIR depends on the type of BMI present, i.e. the positive effect will increase from low to high innovation. In a similar vein, the magnitude of the negative BMI effect in case of high PIR depends on the type of BMI present, i.e. the negative effect will increase from low to high innovation. We further assume that marketing instruments will reduce the negative effect of PIR on purchase intention.
Further course of research
For the proposed full paper, we will continue to work on our data analysis and seek to further elaborate on the theoretical foundations of our study.
Implications
We hope our work will contribute to current BMI research by discussing consumer resistance in light of BMI. We seek to provide decision-makers not only with the awareness of failure of BMI due to consumer resistance, but also with useful marketing instruments in order to overcome these resistances.","Castellion, G., & Markham, S.

"HEIDENREICH, SVEN","KILLMER, JAN","MILLEMANN, JAN",,,,,NOW OR NEVER? INVESTIGATING DETERMINANTS OF CONSUMER LEAPFROGGING BEHAVIOR,03 - Emerging and Early Research (Young Scholars Track),"Failure rates of innovations range around 50 % depending on the product category (Andrew & Sirkin, 2003; Castellion & Markham, 2013; Clancy, Krieg, & Wolf, 2006). Within this respect consumers’ new product adoption behavior turns out to be a serious problem, as most new products get rejected right from the start (e.g., Heidenreich & Handrich, 2014; Heidenreich & Kraemer, 2015). Nowadays, consumers are regularly confronted with a decision to either buy the latest technology or to wait for an updated and improved version. (Kornish, 2001; Shih & Schau, 2011). Yet, a certain number of early adopters are needed for an innovation to get relatively rapid adopted by the remaining members (Allaway, Berkowitz, & D’Souza, 2003; Mahajan, Muller, & Srivastava, 1990). However, in case many consumers delay their adoption of a new product, the crucial point of early adopters might never get reached, turning the innovation into a market failure. Previous studies suggest leapfrogging behavior – a consumer’s decision to reject the new product in place in order to wait for a superior, subsequent product generation (Talke & Heidenreich, 2014) – to be a main reason for low new product success rates (Herrmann, Sprott, & Schlager, 2015; Weiber & Pohl, 1996). While knowledge on the determinants for leapfrogging behavior is of utmost importance to understand this phenomenon and to derive measures to reduce its occurrence in order to enhance new product success rates, little research effort has been dedicated to investigate the nature of leapfrogging (Kleijnen, Lee, & Wetzels, 2009; Talke & Heidenreich, 2014). In order to close this research gap, the aim of this research is to systematically explore and empirically validate the determinants of the leapfrogging phenomenon.
From a methodological standpoint we applied a three-step approach. First, we performed an extensive systematic literature review to identify previous studies on determinants of innovation rejection in general and leapfrogging behavior in particular. The findings (see table 1) confirm our initial notion that little theoretical and even less empirical evidence is available to explain consumer leapfrogging. All articles were subsequently screened for potential theoretical rationales that might help explaining leapfrogging behavior and provide some hints on potential determinants. Based on this analysis, we derived a typology of potential determinants of leapfrogging behavior. Yet, in order to somehow validate this framework and guarantee that all possible determinants of leapfrogging were identified, we applied an exploratory study in step 2. More specifically, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 443 consumers to explore additional reasons not previously identified in the literature that might be also relevant to explain consumer leapfrogging. The responses were then analyzed and discussed by four independent experts in the field of innovation adoption research. The findings from the semi-structured interviews show, that the common reasons for innovation rejection in general, i.e. active (Heidenreich & Spieth, 2013; Laukkanen, Sinkkonen, & Laukkanen, 2009; Wiedmann, Hennigs, Pankalla, Kassubek, & Seegebarth, 2011) and passive innovation resistance (Heidenreich & Handrich, 2014; Heidenreich & Kraemer, 2015; Oreg, 2003), do not entirely explain consumers leapfrogging behavior. Instead, the results point out that further cognitive characteristics (impulsiveness, impatience) and situational factors (switching costs, product lifecycle) are
particularly helpful to explain leapfrogging behavior. Based on this finding, we introduced a new construct, specifically capturing psychological processes inhibiting consumer leapfrogging behavior. The so called “leap resistance” is seen as a consumer predisposition to instantly buy a new product after market introduction rather than to wait for a superior alternative (i.e. leapfrogging). The third step encompassed a larged-scale empirical study that strived to empirically validate our typology of leapfrogging determinants and to quantify the relative importance of each determinant for the leapfrogging decision. More specifically, we recruited 477 participants from a German market research institute to participate in our online questionnaire. We applied structural equation modeling (SEM) to test our hypotheses.
Overall, the preliminary results depicted in figure 1 show that leapfrogging behavior is primary driven by active innovation resistance, and thus product-specific reasons, but also by our newly introduced construct leap resistance, which significantly inhibited the tendency of consumers to leapfrog. However, neither passive innovation resistance nor transactional resistance did significantly affect leapfrogging behavior.
Our research contributes to the current understanding of new product adoption behavior by providing first empirical insights into determinants of new product leapfrogging behavior. From a theoretical perspective our findings extend adoption theory and especially contribute to the ongoing development of a specific theory on innovation resistance by complementing the previously identified types of passive and active innovation resistance by a new important predisposition in new product adoption contexts, called leap resistance. From a managerial perspective, our research provides new product managers with insights into why consumers decide to leapfrog and thereby providing them with hints on how consumers can be convinced to by a new product right from the start of the market introduction. This should help companies to successfully introduce new products and hopefully reduce current failure rates.

"GALEHBAKHTIARI, SARA ","PERKS, HELEN","MCKECHNIE, SALLY",,,,,UNDERSTANDING VALUE CO-CREATION IN USER INNOVATION NETWORKS IN THE CULTURAL INDUSTRIES,15 - Open Innovation,"The present study unravels the nature of value that is co-created between user innovators within cultural industries, who compete and cooperate within online community-based innovation contests when innovating. It also examines how these innovators interact to develop such value.
Following the McMaster review, policy makers have attempted to drive forward an innovation agenda within the arts (Oakley, 2009). Perretti and Negro (2007) argue that continuous innovation plays a critical role in the film industry, where project teams are configured to create novel creative products (i.e. films) with short life cycles. Their study highlighted how innovation can be influenced by the composition of such teams and related team-level processes.
The concept of value co-creation is receiving significant attention in the innovation literature (Nambisan and Baron, 2007 and 2009; Balka, Raasch and Herstatt, 2013; Franke and Pillar, 2004). However, research has mainly focused on how value is co-created in a dyadic manner between the firm and different stakeholders, namely user innovators. Nevertheless, value can also be formed within user innovators’ social sphere, which is beyond the firm’s control. Indeed, consolidation of views about Service Dominant Logic (S-D Logic) highlights the collaborative nature of value co-creation as well as the concept of ‘value-in-context’ (Vargo, 2008), which takes the contextual nature of value into account and adopts a network-to-network perspective. Moreover, according to Vargo and Lusch (2010), S-D logic conceptualizes relationships and this notion of relationship refers to being embedded within a complex network of other value co-creation relationships.
Web 2.0 has given rise to the proliferation of idea competitions and online community-based innovations contests (OCIC) (Bullinger et al., 2010). In the former, user innovators are merely competitors, whereas in the latter both cooperative and competitive behaviours occur simultaneously. The present study seeks to unravel the nature of value and its formation within such contests. Specifically, it aims to show the way in which value is co-created between peers within such networks and how this value is related to the different modes of interaction when innovation occurs. A single case study approach method is adopted and is based on MoFilm, an online community for freelance film makers, who compete to produce short films and therefore go through the whole process of innovation from generating the initial idea to making the final product. A qualitative study is conducted which involves discussions with community managers, a series of observations and 16 depth interviews with the film makers.
The findings disentangle diverse types of value (e.g. hedonic, symbolic and epistemic value) (see Holbrook, 2006) and show the interplay between such value types and different modes of interaction when innovation occurs. In light of how common user communities have become as a means to spur innovation, these findings have important implications for practitioners. They help to direct managers towards understanding the nature of value that network members co-create and indicate specific modes of interactions that managers should facilitate in order to encourage value co-creation behaviours between user innovators.","Balka, K., Raasch, C. and Herstatt, C.

"GEERTS, ANNELIES ","BLINDENBACH-DRIESSEN, FLOORTJE","VISSCHER, KLAASJAN","DE WEERD-NEDERHOF, PETRA ","VAN LOOY, BART",,,"THE COMPLEX RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN EXPLORATION, EXPLOITATION AND MARKET LEADERSHIP",07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"Since March’s (1991) seminal article “Exploration and exploitation in organizational learning”, exploration and exploitation became key concepts in explaining innovation and firm performance (Wilden, Hohberger, Devinney, & Lavie, 2018). Consensus exists about the necessity for firms to engage in both R&D-based exploration and exploitation activities (Swift, 2016). Prior research mainly focuses on performance effects at a firm level (Belderbos, Faems, Leten, & Van Looy, 2010; Mathias, McKenny, & Crook, 2018; Uotila, Maula, Keil, & Zahra, 2009). Today, insights about the performance impact of exploration and exploitation activities in a particular technology field are scarce. This paper provides insight in the complex relationship between exploration, exploitation and market leadership by studying the emergence of a new market.
The research question we address in this paper, is whether the combination of explorative and exploitative research activities in the core technology or adjacent fields are a determining factor to obtain market leadership, as March suggests. Perhaps his theory does not apply in emerging markets, where many other factors may also play a role. In other words, in an emerging market that is driven by new technologies, is market leadership the result of technological leadership? If so, does it matter if this technological leadership is a combination of explorative and exploitative research activities?
The emerging market studied, is the rise of the Asymmetrical Digital Subscriber Line (ADSL) technology in the telecommunication equipment industry. The questions are answered through analyzing a panel dataset of the 17 firms that defined the ADSL market in the period 1990-2003. The dataset involves patent applications (Griliches, 1990; Trajtenberg, 1990) filed in the European Patent Office (EPO), United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), consolidated financial figures and ADSL market data. A distinction is made between ADSL patents and the overall patent portfolio of the firms in the period 1990-1996, before the market entry of ADSL.
Results show that at the emergence of the ADSL market, the technology seemed to be already relatively mature, with mainly exploitative patents being filed by all firms. The technological leader based on patents, Siemens, was never able to gain significant market traction. Instead, market leadership was obtained and maintained throughout this period by Alcatel, who by no means was leading the technology development in the market.
These findings suggest that the theory about the need for firms to combine R&D related exploration and exploitation activities is not sufficient for gaining market leadership in a new technology field. Being successful on the market requires more than technological development. In order to conquer a new technological market, technological capabilities seem not decisive to determine market leadership. We postulate that the determining factor is first to market instead of first to invent.","Belderbos, R., Faems, D., Leten, B., & Van Looy, B. (2010).

"GERSTLBERGER, WOLFGANG ","RIIS, EVA","LUNDØ TRANEKJER, TINA",,,,,HOW CAN GOVERNANCE OF OPEN INNOVATION PROJECTS GENERATE VALUE IN ORGANISATIONS?,15 - Open Innovation,"Open innovation activities are frequently organised as projects and managed through a network of organisations (Lundin et al., 2015). Therefore understanding not only the single open innovation project is important, but also to understand the management structures and processes on the organisational level (Chesbrough, Lettl, & Ritter, 2018). These structures and processes aimed at ensuring that projects generate a discernible value are called ‘Governance of Projects’ (Müller, 2011). They consist of a number of elements that ensure necessary links between the projects and the permanent organisations (Riis, 2015).
Governance of projects has become prominent during the last decade (Aubry, Hobbs, & Thuillier, 2007; Narayanan & DeFillippi, 2012). However, little research has been carried out into the value generated by open innovation projects (Jones & Lichtenstein, 2008), where the organisational form is a project network (Lundin et al., 2015). A project network is understood as consisting of different organisations that collaborate on a project (Hellgren & Stjernberg, 1995) which is an interorganisational project (Jones & Lichtenstein, 2008). This is a central issue related to the outcome of open innovation and Bogers et al. (2017) call for more research in this area.
Research question
The paper addresses the research question: How can governance of open innovation projects generate value in a project network? Emphasis is placed on the complex interplay of links within and between the organisations that ensures that value is generated.
Approach
The paper is based on a review of the previous research literature of the two neighbouring disciplines research on (open) innovation and projects (Davies, Manning, & Söderlund, 2018). It is including both theoretical and empirical work, and identifies elements that have been proposed as important for value generation from open innovation projects. Value is seen as generated following a three-step process: - Identifying value during an open innovation project definition and initiation stage; Creating value by implementing innovation projects and Capturing/harvesting value
in the permanent organisation/receiving organisation by incorporating and utilising the project products – the innovations.
Data and findings
The empirical setting of this paper is the Danish Transportation Industry, struggling with low degree of innovation, lack of capabilities and resources, pressure from competitors and customers, increased globalization as well as trends as digitalization and resource efficiency. Therefore, the Danish transportation firms develop innovations as joint projects with their customers to deal with all these challenges. We have identified in preliminary studies that transportation firms not always have knowledge and know how on how to deal with such types of innovation projects.
The presented framework is tested by conducting empirical case studies in six transportation firms headquartered in Denmark, which implement open innovation projects.
Conclusion and contribution to the field
The paper contributes to developing the understanding of and theory on governance of open innovation projects carried out in project networks. Furthermore, the paper contributes to on-going theoretical work with the aim of cross-fertilization and collaboration between innovation and projects research (Davies, Manning, & Söderlund, 2018).","Aubry, M., Hobbs, B., & Thuillier, D.

"GILAIN, AGATHE ","LE MASSON, PASCAL ","LEVILLAIN, KEVIN","WEIL, BENOIT",,,,MEASURING THE VALUE OF INFORMATION IN THE UNKNOWN: A MODEL AND ITS EXPERIMENTATION ON AN INNOVATION PROJECT PORTFOLIO,17 - Radical Innovation,"Objective, theoretical and practical relevance: Techniques for decision-making in the unknown
Innovation managers need to regularly take investment decisions under uncertainty and in the unknown. Decision theory under uncertainty1,2 provides relevant techniques to deal with uncertainty – but it is now well proved that these techniques are unsuitable (or even misleading) in the unknown3-8.
This leaves investors with “Animal Spirits”9 (optimistic instincts) to justify investments in the unknown. These are not deprived of cognition, but are automatic instant reflections: one perceives their result, but not the reasoning leading to it10.
This highlights the need for a technique formally justifying decisions in the unknown. This paper proposes a measure of the value of the unknown aiming at guiding decision-makers in the unknown – and it experiments this method on a portfolio of innovation projects in one global aircraft manufacturing company.
Literature mapping, key references: Extending decision theory to the unknown
The unknown was long considered as “out of reach” for decision-making techniques 3-6. However recent progress in design theory has made it possible to extend decision theory to the unknown7,8.
But these theoretical advances did not go as far as proposing a new technique to measure the value of the unknown and hence provide a computational model to decide in the unknown. This is the goal of this paper.
Approach, method: A model measuring the unknown
Based on recent extensions of decision theory to the unknown, we use Bayesian statistics11 to develop a measure of the value of information in the unknown, which we experiment on a sample of eleven projects.
Theoretical development, research model, research question: Valuing uncertainty reduction versus valuing unknown exploration
We develop a model measuring the value expected from the structuration of the unknown in pre-investment tests. These tests can both reduce uncertainty and structure the unknown. This represents two very different types of value, both
interesting and valuable, but which require very different types of management of the pre-investment test.
Therefore, our research question is: how can we estimate and distinguish between the value of uncertainty and the value of the unknown?
Our model helps clarify, for a given project, the value to be gained by exploring the unknown and the value to be gained by reducing uncertainty. The model hence predicts how, confronted to an innovation project, decision-makers might choose to stop the project or favour pre-investment tests, with in this latter case a focus either on unknown exploration or uncertainty reduction.
Data, findings: Experimentation on a project portfolio
Based on a sample of eleven innovation projects, we test the capacity of our model to correctly predict whether a project should be stopped, or launched either with an uncertainty reduction or an unknown exploration approach.
Conclusion, contribution: Isolating the unknown within representations of uncertainty
Uncertainty can be measured, for instance by valuing managerial flexibility (Real Options12), or even explicitly represented (within tools, methods) in order to provide decision-makers with reliable and relevant information for decision-making13. Isolating and valuing radical uncertainty9 (i.e. the unknown), our model contributes to this research.
Managerial implications: Investment justification in the unknown and adapted managerial approach selection
Our model offers managers a technique formally justifying investment decisions in the unknown, beyond intuitions.
If the unknown is explicitly isolated, the risk of selecting ill-adapted (not flexible enough)14 managerial approaches to face unknown-unknowns15, concept shift16…is reduced.","Savage L.J.

"GLOMBIK, SOPHIE","HÖLZLE, KATHARINA",,,,,,PERFORMANCE CONTRIBUTIONS OF INFORMAL ROLES IN INNOVATION MANAGEMENT – A REVIEW AND ANALYSIS OF THE LITERATURE,20 - Theory Development in Innovation Research,"Research on digital transformation seems to agree that digitalization is characterized by a
high degree of innovation (Hinings, Gegenhuber & Greenwood, 2018; Kane et al., 2017;
Nambisan et al., 2017; Yoo, Henfridsson & Lyytinen, 2010). Hence, well-known theories from
innovation management are becoming increasingly important. Innovation research has
revealed the importance of key actors for overcoming innovation barriers (Hölzle, 2014;
Mirow, 2010). Numerous studies have proven the positive influence of informal roles on
innovation success (Gemünden, Salomo & Hölzle, 2007; Howell, Shea & Higgins, 2005).
Thereby, the vast majority of the work in this area has focused on promotors and champions.
The impact of promotors and champions on innovation success is an important area of
enquiry. However; to date, no known study has focused primarily at performance
contributions of those informal roles. Performance contributions are specific tasks
performed to successfully introduce and realize innovations. This is particularly important in
times of increasing rapid change driven by digital transformation (Nambisan et al., 2017). By
performing a structured literature review on performance contribution of promotors and
champions this study aims to address this issue. Moreover, this study sought to shed light on
existing research on these two informal roles, emerged research gaps and possible future
research avenues. Thus, the research provides a basis for a critical analysis of the
performance contributions and the possible future applicability of the two models.
2. APPROACH AND RESEARCH MODEL
A structured literature analysis on performance contributions of informal roles namely
promotors and champions was conducted using Tranfield, Denyer & Smart's (2003)
systematic review approach. The search for relevant scientific literature in English and
German has been performed in two large databases. Based on the literature review, we
carried out an in-depth analysis. As a result, the performance contributions have been
collected and systematized. In order to facilitate a meaningful empirical analysis of
performance contributions, related key concepts and bibliometric networks, a combination
of the bibliometric methods of co-word analysis and co-citation analysis have been
performed.
3. (PRELIMINARY) FINDINGS
The analysis reveals four general and one specific preliminary finding regarding performance
contributions: (1) Promotor research is strongly focused on the promotor model itself and its
design. In that context, research has focused on the interaction of promotors as well as
personal characteristics and skills of promotors. (2) With regard to the champion model,
research is more focused on specific applications. For example, studies have explored the
impact of IT on new product development, the application of the model in individual
industries, and the role of champions in external knowledge absorption. (3) The analysis
shows that promotor and champion research often refers to the seminal, earlier sources. In
doing so, the appropriate critical review of their actuality is not taken into account. (4)
Additionally, research indicates a marginal dominant use of quantitative over qualitative
research methods. (5) Existing research has only named some performance contributions of
individual informal roles. However, it is striking that they are often associated with
overcoming innovation barriers. In many cases, important additional contributions are not
considered.
4. CONCLUSION AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD
The work contributes to a more in-depth examination of the topicality of individual informal
roles and the associated performance contributions. Furthermore, the research creates a
basis for further investigations of informal roles. The research offers the opportunity to
review a shift of performance contributions with regard to recent developments. The digital
transformation leads to far-reaching changes in organizational structure, working methods
and the development of innovations. Therefore, future research will need to examine how
these changes will affect contributions.","Gemünden, H.G., Salomo, S., Hölzle, K. (2007) Role Models for Radical Innovations in Times of Open

"MILENA GOLDBERG, JANINA","SCHIELE, HOLGER",,,,,,ASSESSING SUPPLIER INNOVATIONS: WHICH SIDE OF THE SCALE WEIGHS HEAVIER - THE QUALITY OF THE INNOVATION IDEA OR THE INNOVATION IMPLEMENTATION ABILITY OF THE SUPPLIER?,13 - New Methods and Methodological Issues in Innovation Research,"Previous research shows, that besides the “classical” innovation success factors, which are, buying company related, market related or innovation type related (Ensminger and Surry, 2008, Kotter, 1996, Lambooij and Koster, 2016), early supplier integration (ESI) in new product development (NPD) is closely tied to NPD project success (Dekkers et al., 2013). But the success of ESI in innovation processes is not always guaranteed. Two kinds of problems can occur: an unsuitable supplier selection and/or a poor project execution of or with the supplier, which both leads to project obstruction through supplier obstructionism (Flynn et al., 2000, Hartley et al., 1997, Primo and Amundson, 2002). This implies, that not only do “bad” innovations fail but also a certain number of “good” innovations fails due to poor supplier innovation execution performance. Thus, for organizations, it is important to choose both the “right” innovation ideas and the “right” suppliers. Although most innovations are provided by suppliers, surprisingly existing innovation assessment models, tend to focus only on analyzing the potential of the considered innovative idea (e.g. Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1987, Heesen, 2009), but do not reflect the importance of supplier involvement as a new NPD reality.
Figure 1: “Supplier Innovation Matrix” according Goldberg and Schiele (2018)
In the extended literature review only the qualitative study of Goldberg and Schiele (Goldberg and Schiele, 2018) was found that explicitly focuses on supplier innovations and the assessment of the innovative supplier. Within this study a scoring model, which evaluates a supplier innovation from two sides – the innovation idea side and the supplier side - was developed (Goldberg and Schiele, 2018). The scoring
result is visualized within a matrix, from which “Go” or “No-Go” recommendations can be derived and in which two new categories ((2) and (3)) appear, for which the recommendations are not obvious yet (figure 1) (Goldberg and Schiele, 2018).
The goal of this study is to empirically test the entire model, to discover whether the innovation evaluation side weighs heavier or the supplier evaluation side, and further to analyze, if there are some parameters more relevant within the evaluation than others.
According to Cooper and Kleinschmidt a successful innovation project is financially successful, has an impact on its market and opens new opportunities (Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1987). We hypothesize that the innovation realization power of the supplier (H1) and the quality of the innovation idea (H2) has an impact on the innovation project success at the buying company.
Figure 2: Theoretical model for quantitative analysis.
Derived from the qualitative study of Goldberg and Schiele (2018) we hypothesize, that the “quality” of the employees of the supplier (H3a), the creative potential (H3b), the endurance of the supplier (H3c) and the preferential treatment (H3d) have an impact on the innovation realization power of the supplier and that the market potential (H4a), the influence on the existing business model (H4b), the market/customer acceptance (H4c), the cost-benefit analysis (H4d) and the proof of concept (H4e) have an impact on the quality of the innovation idea. The theoretical model is shown in figure 2.
To test our hypotheses a survey will be conducted, in which a questionnaire will be send out to approximately 3000 companies from different industries and countries. If we assume, that at least 10% of the companies will reply, we can use the 300 answers to statistically test the relevance of the items and the validity of the hypotheses. We expect, that the results will show, which of the two sides – the supplier side (H1) or
the innovation idea side (H2) – has a higher impact on the innovation project success and which sub-criterions (H3a-d and H4a-e) are more relevant than the others.
This study will contribute to existing literature by empirically testing and improving an operational usable tool for supplier innovation evaluation. It will be shown, if the supplier evaluation or the innovation idea evaluation is more important for innovation project success. Moreover, the resulting evaluation tool, will help companies to choose the most promising supplier innovations and to reduce the innovation project failure rate.","COOPER, R. G. & KLEINSCHMIDT, E.

"GOWOREK, HELEN ","OXBORROW, LYNN",,,,,,INTEGRATING SUSTAINABILITY IN NPD,10 - Managing Sustainability in Innovation and Product Development,"Addressing sustainability has become a significant management issue and the clothing industry in particular has been scrutinised by academics and the media regarding both its social and environmental sustainability impacts. Whilst the steps in New Product Development (NPD) stage-gate models have the potential to incorporate approaches to enhance product sustainability, the literature lacks models that address such issues. As a sector that thrives on innovation and intentional obsolescence, sustainable fashion seems somewhat of an oxymoron. Our multi-disciplinary study explores this tension by investigating industry practitioners' experience and attitudes towards sustainability and evaluating ways in which the results could be applied to the NPD process. Therefore, our main objective is to assess the technical and strategic barriers and enablers in relation to developing more sustainable products.
Literature
Each NPD stage can potentially impact negatively upon the environment and the European Commission (2012) claim that most of a product’s environmental impact could be determined at the design stage. NPD incorporates idea generation, market screening, commercialisation and technical developments, leading to design and specification for items prior to production (Swink et al., 2010). Sustainable NPD requires multi-disciplinary co-operation between departments such as design, merchandising, production, marketing and corporate responsibility in order to achieve both customer value and sustainable design (Hong et al., 2009; Curwen et al., 2012). Underpinning by organisational values and a systems-thinking approach are required to address sustainability holistically (Hong et al., 2009), if those involved in NPD are to be able to act effectively in this respect.
Method
The study used mixed qualitative research methods to elicit opinions and attitudes. Industry perspectives were investigated via semi-structured interviews and round table discussions, to identify barriers and opportunities for NPD that supports more sustainable clothing. The sample comprised specialists in NPD or sustainability within clothing companies who influenced sustainability policies for clothing selection and production within their organisations, chosen using purposive sampling.
Findings
The findings revealed numerous examples of socially and environmentally sustainable good practice that could be incorporated into various stages of the NPD process. For example, designing more durable products and selecting more sustainable materials and componentry could be applied to the initial stages. Improving the transparency of supply chains could be implemented during the commercialisation phase, relating to both environmental and social sustainability. NPD could also facilitate the environmental sustainability during consumers’ ownership of clothing, through consideration of care labelling and maintenance, recognising that decisions made during NPD can extend to the subsequent phases of products’ lifespan. Amongst the barriers to improving sustainability were limited knowledge of sustainability amongst NPD teams and a lack of management support for addressing sustainability issues, which can restrict the agency of product development specialists. Making clothing companies responsible for take-back programmes for products could encourage the production of more sustainable clothes and the development of more sustainable NPD from the outset.
Conclusion
The findings of this study have implications for theory in that they can be used to adapt the NPD process model to incorporate environmental and social sustainability issues applicable to various product sectors. The revised model could then be implemented by managers to enhance sustainability within NPD practice, to the benefit of the environment and society.","Curwen, L. G., Park, J. and Sarkar, A. K.

"STUART, GRANT",,,,,,,IINSIGHT MOMENT: EXPLORING CUSTOMER NEEDS AND CUSTOMER INSIGHT GENERATION IN NPD,01. Creativity in New Product Development,"Uncovering customer needs and customer insights has been shown to lead to successful
products (Cooper, 1999; Griffin and Page, 1996). Carrying out market research and interpreting
the research data improves the chances a company develops a successful product (Elfvengren
et al., 2004). The definitions of customer needs and customer insights have been discussed by
various authors. In the ‘voice of the customer’ (VOC) Griffin and Hauser (1993) stated that
“customer needs are the problems that a product solves and the functions it performs, they
describe what products let you do, not how you do it” (1993, p.4). VOC remains popular
(Bharadwaj, Nevin and Wallman, 2012), however recently there has been criticism, using the
directly articulated VOC statements led to the development of incremental products (Goffin et
al., 2012). Because customers reference today’s solutions, becoming fixated on current
products and the issues they currently have (Goffin and Lemke, 2004; Patnaik and Becker,
1999). Understanding the needs and insight relationship may assist NPD to overcome the
incremental innovation trap.
In the context of product innovation, the process of uncovering customer needs and
discovering customer insights is complex (Goffin et al., 2012), there is limited research on the
relationship between customer needs and customer insights. The definitions and relationship
of a need and insight is unclear, causing them to often be used interchangeably in the literature.
Therefore, a systematic literature review was undertaken to understand if these terms were
distinct concepts.
In reviewing the definitions from the literature, it was acknowledged that a need is from
the customer perspective; it is owned by the customer not the company. In reviewing the
published definitions, a new definition that takes into account the unarticulated aspect of need
is proposed, “A deep understanding by the company that expresses the future customer values
and benefits of a product’s use”. Though a need is from the customer perspective, it appears
from the literature that a customer insight is generated by the company. A new customer insight
definition is proposed, “A statement that expresses deep knowledge about the customer, this
knowledge is a novel interpretation and once discovered is actionable”. In addition, the process
of insight discovery should also be defined as ‘a sudden comprehension, realization, or problem
solution that involves a reorganization of the elements of a person’s [or team] mental
representation of a situation to yield a non-obvious interpretation’. These definitions
complement each other and show the story that reveals the underlying emotions and values the
customer holds and the benefits the product provides to the customer.

The paper provides a systematic literature review on customer needs and customer
insights. With the aim to understand what customer needs and customer insights are and how
they relate to each other in product innovation. Two definitions of a customer need and of a
customer insight are developed from the literature.
However, it remains unclear how they interact, though some articles suggested that the
discovery of insights follows the uncovering of customer needs this was not fully substantiated.
This phenomenon requires further exploratory research.","Bharadwaj, N., Nevin, J.R. and Wallman, J.P. (2012) ‘Explicating hearing the voice of the customer as a manifestation of

The ecosystem refers to a community of interdependent and co‐specialized organizations,
which combine their individual offerings into a new coherent customer‐facing solution
(Moore, 1996). Building and sustaining ecosystems offer focal new ventures (new ventures
playing focal roles in ecosystems) sustainable competitive advantages. However, they face
various challenges to develop their ecosystems, especially during ecosystems’ early growth
stages. Current ecosystem literature underexplores this issue because they either consider
new ventures as non‐focal roles in ecosystems, or, focus mainly on economic challenges focal
new ventures might suffer. This is not fully applicable to public‐good related industries (e.g.,
full electric vehicle), where focal new ventures often encounter not only economic but also
coopetitive and socio‐political challenges. Therefore, our research question is: how do focal
new ventures build and sustain their emerging ecosystems by successfully addressing
multiple ecosystem challenges?
Brief literature mapping and key references
We integrate ecosystem management literature (e.g., Adner, 2017; Autio & Thomas, 2014)
and theory on industries’ co‐evolution within external environments (e.g., Geels, 2014) to
construct an analytical model. Based on this model, an ecosystem consists of three distinct
institutional ecosystem environments — economic, coopetitive, and socio‐political
environments. Additionally, we take a lifecycle perspective (Moore, 1996) to study the
ecosystem development process in their early stages.
Approach/Method
We choose the multiple case study method. We use critical event method to capture
qualitative data from two successful and two unsuccessful emerging ecosystems in the bikesharing
industry in China. We conclude with within‐ and cross‐case findings using process
analysing strategies.
Data/Findings
First, successful focal new ventures view ecosystems in a broader perspective. They
purposefully create a viable socio‐political environment, which favours economic and
coopetitive environments’ viability. Second, successful focal new ventures often integrate
their ecosystem strategies, instead of implementing them individually. Third, outperformed
focal new ventures take the time into account when taking strategic actions. They adopt suboptimal
strategies in order to prepare themselves for subsequent socio‐political actors’
restricting influences.
Conclusion and contribution to the field
First, our study shows that successful ecosystem development requires focal firms to
address challenges from the socio‐political environment, next to the ones from the economic
and coopetitive environment. This lends support to the calls from Autio and Thomas (2014)
to extend the boundaries of ecosystem management literature towards an institutional and
socio‐technical perspective. Second, we extend ecosystem literature by highlighting the
interactive effects between focal firms’ ecosystem strategies. Our results imply that scholars
2
should pay explicit attention to these multi‐level interaction effects to explain ecosystem
success. Third, we add intertemporal strategic effects among ecosystem strategies to
literature, of which some strategies might look sub‐optimal from the focal firm perspective,
but create positive effects at the ecosystem level in the long‐term. Our study thus
emphasizes the need for more longitudinal studies to understand ecosystems’ success.
Managerial implications
Start‐up entrepreneurs and managers need to be aware of the complex interplay between
the economic, coopetitive and socio‐political environments when building and maintaining
an emerging ecosystem. This requires specific competences in the management team, such
as a long‐term vision, socio‐political sensitivity and knowledge and experience in several
domains.","Adner, R. (2017). Ecosystem as structure: an actionable construct for strategy. Journal of

"HANKER, ANNA-LENA ","SCHUHMACHER, MONIKA C.","WOLTZ, TANJA",,,,,CUSTOMER INTEGRATION IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW AND FUTURE RESEARCH SUGGESTIONS,15 - Open Innovation,"Customers are not simply users of a product or service, but they also actively shape innovation development as ideators (e.g., Schweitzer et al., 2014) co-developers (e.g., Stock et al., 2017), or feedback providers (e.g. Hofstetter et al., 2018). Practitioners and researchers alike have long recognized the innovative potential of integrating customers into new product development (NPD) (e.g., Chesbrough, 2003). Researchers investigating this potential refer to this activity as customer integration (CI) (e.g., Enkel et al., 2005), user involvement (e.g., Jespersen, 2010), consumer participation (e.g., Troye and Supphellen, 2012), co-creation (e.g., Nambisan and Baron, 2009), co-development (e.g., Stock et al., 2017), or crowdsourcing (e.g., Zhu et al., 2017). All of these conceptualizations share the idea of interaction between customers and companies with the aim of innovating new products or services. Specifically, extant research investigates different aspects of CI, such as characteristics of customers (e.g., von Hippel 2001), stages of NPD (e.g., Gruner and Homburg 2000), factors contributing to new product success (e.g., Schuhmacher et al. 2018), or tools for CI (e.g., Fang 2008). In addition, first meta-analyses on this topic exist (e.g., Chang and Taylor 2016). These meta-analyses concentrate on CI in specific stages, technological turbulence of the NPD project, CI in emerging versus developed countries, CI for the development of physical goods versus services, firm size, or study-specific moderators, such as, for example, study designs (e.g. Calantone et al., 2010; Chang and Taylor, 2016). However, these meta-analyses do not account for the highly fragmented research field addressing several, additional interdependent research questions with different foci. Therefore, the aim of our study is to systemize the heterogeneous body of literature by conducting a systematic literature review on the various researched facets of CI in NPD.
Based on a sample of 350 research articles published between 1977 and 2017, we systematically summarize the extant research on CI in NPD. We apply the systematic quantitative assessment technique proposed by Pickering and Byrne (2014) as it allows for a quantification of the vast amount of research. To derive a holistic viewpoint on CI in NPD, we first reflect on corresponding contextual aspects of all studies, e.g., data sources, research methods, theoretical backgrounds, or types of studies. Based on our analysis, we identify ten CI-categories that studies investigate; why to integrate (tasks and motives), when to integrate (stages of NPD), how long to integrate (duration and frequency), how to integrate (tools), whom to integrate (types of customers), where to integrate (industry), for what to integrate (aim and consequences of CI), how is the setting (online, offline, or virtual), who starts the innovation (firms vs. customers), and what are the prerequisites (fostering and hindering conditions) of CI in NPD. For the contextual aspects as well as for each category, we synthesize studies’ focus and findings, derive research gaps, and propose avenues for future research.","Calantone, R. J., N.

Historically, designing is a task devoted to the design office and the methods office. Since the
beginning of the 2000ies, a new industrial paradigm is emerging (industy 4.0, smart industry etc). This
movement reshapes the factory; it also enables to reintroduce the design in it.
The aim of the article is thus to explore what designing means in a factory. It investigates its impact
on the manufacturing system. It finally gives insights about managing the design activity in production.

Lean management brings several methods to solve the problems in production (1). Other
management tools were developed to capture the innovative power of the employees. Suggestion boxes
enable to gather the employees’ ideas (2). Bricolage creates knowledge and encourages the investigation
of new opportunities (3). More generally, the lead-user approach, participatory design, and design
anthropology promote the design with the concerned people, which includes, in a factory, the employees
themselves (4). Finally, all these methods are already implemented in production; what are their
characteristics?
The researches in design present various methods and draw a gradation in the degree of rupture
that they imply. They suggest the co-existence of two regimes of design. The first one would be minimal,
close to problem solving (5). The second one would be more innovative, enabling expansion and leading to
an important impact and an increase in the knowledge (6). Although the first type of design seems to be
consistent with the factory, the second type is more unexpected in a productive context. Thus it is relevant
to investigate its existence and its properties.
Approach/Method/Theoretical framework
The paper builds a model distinguishing the two regimes of design suggested by the literature.
They differ by their methods and their results.
- In the first one, the problems are local and the methods already exist.
- In the second one, the problems concerns whole fields of investigation and the method itself has
to be designed.
Research questions
1) Can we find the two regimes of design formerly modelled ?
2) Do the methods and the levels of performance correspond to the model ? In other terms, is the
performance degree in coherence with the methods of the regime ?
Methods
The paper is based on the sample of 60 cases in the Airbus Saint-Nazaire’s factory between 2013
and 2018. A list of variables is created, describing the characteristics of the design regimes and the methods
used in each of them (composition of the groups, identification and measure of the problem, tests,
iterations…).
Then both a quantitative and qualitative approaches give insights on the hypothesis tested: the
existence of the two regimes and their type of performance.
Main Findings, conclusion and contribution to the field
The article shows that designing does exist in factory. Several methods with various objectives are
found out. A certain type of design is pointed out, less expected in a factory. It is nevertheless ambitious,
brings innovating solutions, and could open a field relevant to explore.
Managerial implications
The paper provides a better understanding of the two regimes of design. It precises their
objectives and their type of results. Moreover, it gives keys to train the production operators and their
managers to the design activity in the factory.","1- Pavnaskar, S. J., J. K. Gershenson, and A. B. Jambekar. ""Classification scheme for lean manufacturing

Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"While prior research studied the collaboration between marketing and internal design in the new product development (NPD) process, little research has been conducted on collaboration between marketing and external design. Yet, many companies outsource design in the NPD process and marketing is often the key contact. A poor relationship between marketing and external design can lead to NPD failure. Furthermore style of practices and types of designers are still unclear leading to various design architecture choices (Abecassis-Moedas and Benghozi, 2012). Sources of design expertise are especially diverse (Zhang, 2014) and strategies that firms use to manage them are still missing in the literature (Ravasi and Stigliani, 2012). Building on a model of drivers and pathways on NPD success in the marketing-external relationship, this paper aims at analyzing how marketing departments and external designers collaborate throughout the NPD process. It contributes to the literature by proposing a taxonomy of collaboration patterns between marketing and external design.
This paper is based on a multiple-case study approach with dyads of marketers and designers. This methodology enabled us to have a clear and precise understanding of this relationship and to generate new insights (Eisenhardt, 1989). Nine case studies have been conducted with 18 semi-structured interviews (nine from marketers and nine from designers) regarding luxury fragrances and cosmetics. This industry was chosen because collaboration between marketing and external design is key in such activities: product design plays a major role in product differentiation; marketing is usually in charge of coordinating the NPD process. By analyzing the process using a sequence of events describing how things change over time (Langley, 1999), we managed to improve our understanding of how each entity perceives the collaboration of the different ways of collaboration based on their respective expertise.
Our findings reveal that the source of design expertise is a determinant of three different patterns of collaboration between marketing and external design:
(1) Applied collaboration is related to collaboration with customer-based external designers characterized by their proximity to customers and their organizational flexibility.
(2) Co-creation collaboration is related to collaboration with process-based external designers who rely on specific creative processes and organizational capabilities.
(3) Co-branding collaboration is related to collaboration with star-based external designers who rely on highly creative and talented individuals who benefit from an international reputation.
Detailed actions and skills associated with each role are discussed and illustrated. Especially, theoretical and managerial implications about the degree of external designers’ creative freedom and the degree of familiarity with the brand in a business-to-business context are presented.","Abecassis-Moedas, Celine and Benghozi, Pierre-Jean.

"HEMPHÄLÄ, JENS","MAGNUSSON, MATS","NILSSON , SUSANNE",,,,,THE INFLUENCE OF UNCERTAINTY MANAGEMENT APPROACHES ON R&D PERFORMANCE IN LARGE-SCALE COMPLEX SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT,16 - Organising New Product Development,"Uncertainty is far from a new term in research and previous research has treated
uncertainty from a number of perspectives; innovation strategies (Lynn and Akgün,
1998), technological uncertainty (Song and Montoya-Weiss, 2001), environmental
uncertainty (Koufteros, et al., 2005), and project uncertainty (Jerbrant, 2014).
However, there is no common understanding as to what uncertainty is in literature
(Perminova et al., 2008), and no coherent theory of uncertainty management has
emerged. Rather, the phenomenon of uncertainty inherited in projects has started to
be discussed and defined from project management perspective (cf. Perminova et al.
2008).
More recent research in project management has started to cover the relationship
between uncertainty management and risk (Dowie, 1999, Chapman and Ward, 2011;
Sanderson, 2012), sources of uncertainty (Martinsuo et al., 2014; Saunders et al., 2015;
Ward and Chapman, 2003), and attribution of meaning to project portfolio
uncertainty (Martinsuo et al., 2014), as well as definitions and conceptualisations of
uncertainty (Perminova et al., 2008; Saunders et al., 2015).
Still, few empirical studies have considered uncertainties in general, their related
consequences and organizational setting, and how different approaches are used in
uncertainty management as well as their effect. As a consequence, the managerial
toolbox relating to uncertainty management in R&D is underdeveloped. The
dominating perspective is still that uncertainty should be reduced (cf. Koufteros, et
al., 2005) rather than managed and still, academics, managers, and developers mainly
lack an understanding in how their ability to manage uncertainties will affect
organisational performance.
This research will test the impact of the uncertainties that are faced in R&D in largescale
complex system development as well as two general uncertainty management
practices (planning approach and adaptation approach) on three aspect of R&D
performance: innovation, incremental performance, and learning. Specifically,
uncertainty practices geared towards increase long term planning is hypothesised to
have a positive effect on incremental performance. However, this relationship is
hypothesised to be negatively moderated by uncertainty. As uncertainty increases,
the positive impact of a planning approach will decrease. The adaptation approach is
manifest in uncertainty management practices that strive to manage uncertainty as it
becomes emergent. These uncertainty practices geared towards increase
adaptiveness is hypothesised to have a positive effect on innovation performance
and learning. This relationship is hypothesised to be positively moderated by
uncertainty. As uncertainty increases, the positive impact of the adaptation approach
will increase.
Respondents to this research are 352 (response frequency 58%) product developers
in two international organisations working with large-scale complex system
development. These respondents were selected as they had all extensive experience
working with R&D, in various projects. The analyses were carried out using multiple
linear regression analyses using SPSS.
The results from this research aid in the understanding the utility of uncertainty
management practices. Managers and academians alike are still struggling to assess
when and why radically different approaches to uncertainty management should be
applied. Some fruitful results are found in the utility of the approaches in relation to
the level of uncertainty.","Chapman, C.B., Ward, S., (2011). How to Manage Project Opportunity and Risk. John

"HOFMANN, BJÖRN ","SCHUHMACHER, MONIKA C.","FEICK, MATHIAS",,,,,TYPE II ERRORS THROUGH THE LENS OF EXPLOITATION AND EXPLORATION,03 - Emerging and Early Research (Young Scholars Track),"Within innovation management, two different types of errors can occur: Type I and
Type II errors (T1E and T2E) (Tellis 2013). T1E, also referred to as failed innovations,
are innovations launched into the market, which do not reach previously set financial or
operational objectives (e.g., Cooper 1979). The academic literature has provided rich
insights on the antecedents of T1E (e.g., Markovitch et al. 2015), such as insufficient
financial resources, wrong marketing, or inferior market research skills (e.g., Cooper
1975; Page 1993). T2E instead, so-called missed innovations, are defined as the nonpursuit
of ideas for innovations, which would have been successful in the marketplace
(Tellis 2013). Compared to the rich insights on T1E, research is silent on the drivers of
T2E. This pause in research is surprising as T2E can lead to high opportunity costs in the
form of foregone profits for the focal firm (Baker and Albaum 1986; Tellis 2013).
Consequently, our study aims to shed light on potential drivers of T2E in innovation
management.
Taking on an organizational learning perspective (e.g., March 1991), we draw on the
exploitation-exploration framework for the development of innovations and argue that a
focus on exploitation increases and on exploration reduces the number of T2E. We refer
to exploitation as “the use and development of things already known” and to exploration
as “the pursuit of new knowledge, of things that might become known” (Levinthal and
March 1993, p. 105). In this context, the former is associated with incremental and the
latter with radical changes (or innovations, respectively), creating tensions between the
two (e.g., Benner and Tushman 2003; March 1991). Moreover, formalization, i.e., the
degree of adherence to rule-guided procedures, is a recurring theme in research on
exploitation and exploration (Jansen, Van Den Bosch, and Volberda 2006; Gurtner and
Reinhardt 2016). We assume that the formalization of the innovation development
process (IDP), such as the implementation of a stage-gate-system as an example for a
high formalization (Cooper 2008), moderates the effect of exploitation and exploration on
the number of T2E.
In a first round of data collection using an online survey, we received 50 valid
responses from innovation, product, and project managers. The firms in the sample serve
B2B (44%), B2C (16%), and B2B/B2C markets (40%). Further, the majority of firms
employs on average more than 1,000 employees (58%). Overall, we find that exploration
drives the number of T2E, while exploitation does not have an impact on the number of
T2E. However, accounting for the degree of formalization of the IDP, we show that an
increase in exploration as well as exploitation lead to a higher number of T2E the greater
the formalization of the IDP.
In total, we contribute to the literature on innovation management, especially in the
largely unexplored field of drivers of T2E. Furthermore, we add to the ongoing
discussion about the relevance of a formalized IDP for successful innovation
management (e.g., Eling, Griffin, and Langerak 2016; Schultz et al. 2013).","Baker, Kenneth G. and Gerald S. Albaum (1986), “Modeling New Product Screening

"HURMELINNA-LAUKKANEN, PIA","YANG, JIALEI",,,,,,CHANGING VIEWS ON INNOVATION APPROPRIABILITY: A SYSTEMATIC LITERATURE REVIEW,20 - Theory Development in Innovation Research,"Recently, new research has emerged to consider different facets of value appropriability
and value appropriation of innovation (e.g., Alnuaimi and George, 2016; Alexy et al.,
2018; Helfat and Raubitschek, 2018). The newly awakened interests and fresh viewpoints
are the product of changes in the operations environment (e.g., Hoffmann et al., 2018;
Teece, 2018) and certain questioning ‘raison d’être’ of business organizations;
organizational boundaries are noted to be permeable to quite different extent nowadays,
and the value generation logics of companies have evolved into new frontiers (Ahuja,
Lampert, and Novelli, 2013).
These developments have challenged research with regard to the ways in which the
contemporary phenomena are captured and communicated further. A number of studies
ask for an update of appropriability discussion to match the contemporary business
environment (e.g., Belderbos et al., 2014; Spithoven and Teirlinck, 2015; Appleyard and
Chesbrough, 2017). In this study, we review existing literature with the aim to introduce
needed framing and vocabulary for future research, and to provide practical suggestions
for managers operating in different settings. In particular, we distinguish between
innovation appropriability and appropriation (and the underlying constructs) in order to
find out, how innovating organizations increase their readiness to respond to emerging
opportunities and threats, and how they unleash their innovation potential. In this, we pay
attention to the developments in the business context as described in the existing
literature.
A systematic review of 197 appropriability and appropriation related publications from
databases of ABI/INFORM Complete, Business Source Complete, and Scopus shows
how appropriability and appropriation have been approached during the last three
decades. We find sets of mechanisms and structures that innovating organizations
develop and acquire to increase innovation appropriability, that is, the potential to benefit
and profit from innovation. We further identify different processes and practices in which
these mechanisms and structures are put in use, that is, activities through which
appropriability turns into actual appropriation—realization of the potential. We also track
changes in time that result from the changes in the business practices and innovation
environments related to increasing connectedness, for example.
Our review indicates that, first, there is a quite persisting tendency to theorize by
focusing on the selection of appropriability mechanisms, and on comparisons of formal
and informal mechanisms. At the same time, examination of more recent studies suggests
that questioning adequacy of these views in the contemporary environments is warranted
(e.g., Appleyard and Chesbrough, 2017), meaning that managers might also want to
consider alternative approaches. Second, our review suggests that the structures behind
appropriability can be complements or substitutes, independent and additive. The
structures link closely to the processes in which they are used, but research still seems to
miss some of these connections (e.g., Wen, Ceccagnoli, and Forman, 2016). Third, what
seems to be a recent addition to the discussion, is abandoning the use of some
mechanisms (sometimes in favor of others) (e.g., Holgersson, Granstrand, and Bogers,
2018). Our findings suggest that the related patterns and underlying logics of innovation
appropriability call for further research and managerial attention.","Ahuja, G., C. M. Lampert, and E. Novelli. 2013. The Second Face of Appropriability:

"JAHANMIR, SARA F. ","LAMAS, ALEJANDRO",,,,,,FACING LATE ADOPTERS’ RESISTANCE TO INNOVATIONS: JOINT PRICING AND OPERATIONS PLANNING FOR NEW PRODUCTS’ LAUNCH,"04 - Engineering, Production and Supply Issues in Innovation and Product Development","We study the joint marketing and operations planning of a firm that launches a durable technological innovation during a discrete a finite horizon. Traditionally, new product demand models assume that the customer’s behavior depends on the time of adoption and the social influence of the previous adopters (Bass, 1969; Rogers, 2010).This study adapts diffusion models to scenarios where the demand also depends on the adopters’ willingness to pay. Our approach is line with recent research which shows that Rogers’ late majority and laggards (hereafter referred to as late adopters) have distinctive characteristics which allow them to stand out from other members of Bass’s imitators. Late adopters are characterized by a preference for lower prices, i.e. lower willingness to pay (Jahanmir & Lages, 2016). Therefore, we use willingness to pay as a measure of resistance to innovations of different adopter categories.
Given this perspective, the objectives of this article are (a) to address the role of resistance of late adopters in marketing and operations efforts when launching new products and (b) to provide a framework for joint production and pricing decisions for novel products in order to maximize profit. To do so, we model the production activities through the established Wagner and Whitin dynamic lot-sizing problem (LSP) (see Wagner & Whitin, 1958; Brahimi et al., 2006; Lamas & Chevalier, 2018). The LSP assumes the demand to be an exogenous parameter. However, in order to capture interactions between marketing and operations, we assume a price sensitive demand, the diffusion of which depends on the Generalized Bass Model (GBM) for discrete horizons. We characterize the optimality conditions of the joint planning in such a way that we implement algorithmic approaches, which lead to optimal pricing and production decisions in a tractable time.
Our numerical experiments show that underestimating the resistance of late adopters may lead to inaccurate demand forecast, which translates to excess of stock, increase of stock-outs and loss of revenues. We also show that making pricing decisions separately from operations may hurt significantly the profits of a firm. Moreover, we provide evidence of the significant gains derived from setting a dynamic price across time in comparison to setting a fixed price for new products.
This study constitutes a novel approach that contributes to the theory and practice of marketing/production of new products by proposing models and algorithms that, while incorporating different adopter profiles, simultaneously solve dynamic pricing, demand modeling and production/inventory problems. Findings may also help practitioners to design production and sales plans that maximize profit during the product’s life cycle. Start-ups and new ventures can benefit from our modeling in order to cross the chasm, survive and grow.

Using an experimental design in which the interface visual design is manipulated, as well as two studies, the authors test a three-path mediational model through which usability and pleasure mediate the relationship between visual design and system acceptance. The first study is a laboratory experiment using two actual websites of e-commerce retailers, and the second study implements an online experiment using fictional interfaces developed by a web designer. Results show that visual design exerts a direct effect on both usability and pleasure and, unexpectedly, an indirect effect, but no direct effect, on system acceptance. The findings also reveal that the positive influence of usability on system acceptance does not occur directly but rather indirectly through pleasure. That is, highly usable systems trigger a sense of pleasure that favors system acceptance. The alternative serial mediation model in which pleasure precedes usability is not supported.

"JEANNOT, FLORENCE","DAMPÉRAT, MAUD","JONGMANS, ELINE","JOLIBERT, ALAIN",,,,TOWARD A DEEPER UNDERSTANDING OF THE MECHANISMS UNDERLYING DESIGN THINKING,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Many companies encourage their internal teams to be creative to foster innovation and thus improve their products (Godart et al., 2015) and competitiveness (Bissola et al., 2014). From this perspective, the design thinking method is becoming increasingly popular within companies and has been successful in terms of innovation (Carlgren et al., 2016). Design thinking is a human-centred product design method that offers a specific approach for implementing creative processes (Brown, 2008). It differs from other product design methods in two ways. First, consumer needs and uses represent a major and early interest in design thinking, given that an in-depth consumer study can consume nearly 50% the total time allocated to the process. Second, the design thinking method prototypes the user experience, thereby ultimately allowing the user to better appropriate the solution offered. Although design thinking has become very important in organisations, academic work on this subject remains sparse and mainly adopts a theoretical perspective (Johansson-Sköldberg et al., 2013).
This research proposes and empirically tests the modelling of a design thinking-based creativity process that includes the distinctive role of individual variables at each stage. This model integrates the three stages of design thinking that were proposed by Brown (2008), namely, need definition, idea production and solution prototyping. It also establishes relationships between the key concepts associated with each stage and studies the influence of three individual variables, namely, empathy, domain-relevant familiarity and task involvement, on each stage of the creative process. A preliminary study—pretesting of measurement scales and inclusion of 172 responses—and a main study—testing of proposed model and inclusion of 177 responses—are conducted. Data collection is performed for the main study with teams of four to five engineering students after a three-session team creative process. Each team designs an original concept that meets the challenge of a French company operating in collaborative engineering online services. Fifteen research hypotheses are simultaneously tested using structural equation modelling, and most of them are supported. Scales for specific concepts associated with design thinking are developed and validated. Finally, the predictive validity of the team creative process is confirmed via its positive impact on the evaluation of the solutions as judged by external experts.
Research on team creativity has been fruitful over the last several decades and has focused on the determinants of creative performance; by contrast, less attention has been given to the specific mechanisms underlying team creativity on the basis of design thinking (Liedtka, 2014). The first contribution of this work is offering companies a deeper understanding of the mechanisms underlying design thinking and thus providing a protocol and recommendations
for effective implementation. The second contribution is identifying the profiles of the participants needed in a team for promoting collective creative production. The last contributions are conceptually clarifying the process of design thinking-based co-creativity, producing reliable and valid measurement scales and empirically testing the proposed modelling method.","Bissola R, Imperatori B et Colonel RT (2014) Enhancing the creative performance of new product teams: An organizational configurational approach.

In technical, product development and contemporary innovation processes, it is largely recognised that Proofs-of Concept (PoCs) are critical for validation (Mankins, 1995; Cooper & Sommer, 2016; Yu, Pasinelli & Brem, 2018). If PoCs are also known to provoke interest and involvement of the designer community (Woodman, Sawyer & Griffin, 1993), their generativity power still needs to be clarified. Indeed, PoCs as all creativity management tools can create well-known biases that decrease generativity: (a) cognitive biases (fixation effect, reduced exploration, …) (Agogué & Cassotti, 2013), (b) collaborative biases (tensions, conflicts creation, …) (Dubois & al., 2014), etc. Since exceeding these biases is critical, we focused our research question on how to manage PoCs to overcome biases in generativity.
➢ Brief literature mapping and key references
In fact, a plethora of methods of collaborative design activities have been developed over the years (Sanders & Stappers, 2008) including the use of boundary objects (Star & Griesemer, 1989) such as stimulators, demonstrators, and prototypes (Ben Mahmoud-Jouini & al., 2013). However, there has been little research on the conditions under which such activities may occur, as well as the effects on creative communities (Schwarz & Krabbendam, 2013).
Moreover, Agogué and Cassotti (2013) showed that through their curriculum industrial designers develop expansive heuristics leading to a greater ability to expand from the fixation effect (Jansson & Smith, 1991). Literature is investigating how to exceed these cognitive effects (Smith, Linsey & Kerne, 2010, Agogué & al., 2011, Hatchuel, Le Masson & Weil, 2011). Hatchuel & al. (2011) especially propose a theoretical framework of generativity that is defined as the ability to create new propositions that go beyond the initial knowledge of the designer. This work opened a way to assess the creative capacities of collectives (Agogué & al., 2013) and compare PoCs by applying generativity criteria.
➢ Research question
Along these lines, can we design ‘generative PoCs’ which would contribute to a collective exploration of the unknown in its dual cognitive and collective component?
➢ Approach/Method
In this study, we adopted a theory-building approach (Eisenhardt & Graebner, 2007) based on a multiple-case study with embedded units of analysis and a sample of cases chosen for their likelihood to offer theoretical insight (Yin, 1994). We investigated five retrospective and on-going PoCs designed by SISMO, a French independent design studio recognised by public/private organisations for its strategic approaches to support innovation.
➢ Data/Findings
Based on interviews, observations, and archival data, we propose a theoretical model of ‘generative PoCs’ management based on managerial patterns developed by SISMO. The major elements of this result is about: (a) overcoming cognitive biases by PoC support of individuals’ generativity and controlling variety and originality of each individual’s set of ideas, (b) overcoming collective biases by making PoCs « action-learning », i.e. users are not only involve but are also enable to acquire design capabilities.
➢ Conclusion and contribution to the field & Managerial implications
Indeed, this study aims to help managerial researchers and practitioners distinguish between individual and collective patterns for innovation capabilities and provide a model of generative performance for different types of PoCs.","Agogué, M., & Cassotti, M.

"KAUFMANN, CARSTEN ","KOCK, ALEXANDER","GEMÜNDEN, HANS GEORG",,,,,REAL OPTIONS THINKING AS BEHAVIORAL ATTITUDE TO IMPROVE PORTFOLIO INNOVATIVENESS AND PORTFOLIO SUCCESS,07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"Portfolio innovativeness—the extent to which a firm’s innovation portfolio consists of highly innovative projects—plays a key role in achieving portfolio success. Several studies documented a positive influence of portfolio innovativeness on overall portfolio success and firm performance (Schultz, Salomo, and Talke, 2013; Talke, Salomo, and Kock, 2011). Important antecedents of portfolio innovativeness are a firm’s innovation culture (Kock, Heising, and Gemünden, 2015; Kleinschmidt, Brentani, and Salomo, 2007) and its strategic orientation (Cooper and Kleinschmidt, 1995; Rosenbusch, Rauch, and Bausch, 2013). For the latter, we focus on the entrepreneurial orientation (Covin and Slevin, 1991; Rauch et al., 2009) as a mindset of “favoring actions with uncertain outcomes” (Anderson et al., 2015).
Since innovative projects are connected with a much higher degree of uncertainty, the decision-making process linked to Innovation Portfolio Management (IPM) is especially challenging (Schultz et al., 2013; Kester et al., 2011). A potential way of addressing the challenges of IPM is Real Options Thinking (ROT). ROT is a behavioral attitude implemented to reduce uncertainty, maintain flexibility and anticipate future performance of selectable options by placing low investments first, investing sequentially, and reallocating funds between options (Klingebiel and Adner, 2015; Myers, 1977; Reuer and Tong, 2007). Applied on the portfolio process, ROT therefore offers an opportunity to cope with innovative projects’ uncertainty and thus potentially increase the general portfolio innovativeness, which then positively influences the overall portfolio success (Talke, Salomo, and Kock, 2011).
However, existing empirical literature remains unclear on how the introduction of ROT relates to portfolio innovativeness and especially how its application interacts with the cultural and strategic innovation context of a firm. We therefore formulate our research question as follows: How does the implementation of ROT, supported by the strategic and cultural context, affect portfolio innovativeness and portfolio success?
Based on the literature on real options and portfolio decision making, we hypothesize that the relationship between implementation of ROT and portfolio innovativeness is positively moderated by the firm’s entrepreneurial orientation and its innovation culture.
We test our hypotheses with hierarchical regression analysis, using a sample of 136 innovation portfolios and three kinds of informants for each portfolio: a senior manager (decision maker on selection, prioritization, or termination of projects), a portfolio manager (with a good overview of the portfolio process), and one or more project managers. This survey design combines different hierarchic perspectives on the portfolio process and reduces common method bias.
The findings support the positive influences of innovation culture and entrepreneurial orientation on portfolio innovativeness. The positive interaction between entrepreneurial orientation and ROT on portfolio innovativeness is also supported. Surprisingly, we do not find a similar effect for innovation culture.
This study contributes to existing literature by specifically investigating the influence of ROT on portfolio innovativeness in combination with the strategic and cultural innovation context of the firm. For managers, the findings underline the essential contributing role of entrepreneurial orientation when implementing ROT.","Cooper, Robert G. and Elko J. Kleinschmidt. 1995.

"KAWAKAMI, TOMOKO ","SEICHI, FUJII","NAKAMURA, TOMOYA",,,,,"ORGANIZATIONAL CULTURE, STRUCTURE AND PROCESS AS THE ANTECEDENTS OF SERIAL INNOVATORS",16 - Organising New Product Development,"This research explores the antecedent factors to enhance the existence level of serial innovators. While the studies on serial innovators were mainly conducted on their individual characteristics and abilities (e.g., Price et al., 2009; Griffin et al., 2012; Griffin et al., 2014), this research focuses on how organizational factors facilitate or hinder the emergence of serial innovators.
Based on the exploratory quantitative and qualitative studies, we develop a conceptual model and test the hypotheses collected from Japanese manufacturing firms in 2018. The results will provide implications for firms on how to change their organizational structure, culture and NPD management to produce more serial innovators for radical innovations.
Brief literature mapping and key references
Serial innovators are defined as those who understand customers’ needs, champion the development processes, implement all the necessary activities with the help of other members, and in turn, contribute to the company’s performance in innovations (Griffin, Price, and Vojak, 2012). Studies on serial innovators have been accumulated in the decade, but empirical evidence on organizational factors are still limited (Griffin, Price, and Vojak, 2012).
Furthermore, the findings are mainly from the individualistic cultures. For example, Corradini, Battisti and Demirely (2016) have analyzed serial innovators in small vs. large companies in the U.K. and found that serial innovators in small companies benefit more from high-quality patents in the specialized fields than those who in large companies. To date, however, few studies are conducted on Asian companies.
Based on this understanding of the gap in the extant literature, this research collects data from Asia, more specifically Japan which is known for its highly collectivistic culture.
Approach and Methodology
First, we conducted an exploratory quantitative survey to find where serial innovators exist in Japan from January to February 2016. The survey respondents were 284 with the 17.8% response rate. From this exploratory survey, we found that the average number of serial innovators in Japan is around 4 out of 100 engineers.
Then we started to contact with these serial innovators who responded to the survey and met them one person to another. The interviewees were from various industries including both BtoB and BtoC companies, covering such industries as pharmaceutical, beverage, apparel, cosmetic, metal, chemical, semiconductor among others. The total length of the interview was 1,643 hours.
After transcribing all the recorded interviews, three researchers in this project analyzed the interview note independently in order to hypothesize the relationships between the constructs mentioned in the interviewees’ words. After the discussions, we agreed on the key constructs and their priorities to develop a conceptual model for empirical test.
Conceptual Model
Our hypothesized conceptual model is shown in Figure 1. In this model, we conceptualized that three organizational factors affect emergence of serial innovators, and in turn, innovation performance. The antecedent organizational factors are 1) organization culture, 2) NPD process and 3) organizational structure.
In the 1) organization structure aspect, two factors are included; risk taking and organizational innovativeness. In the 2) NPD process aspect, fluidity of NPD stages and open innovation orientation are included. Finally, in the 3) organizational structure aspect, marketing-R&D integration factor will be investigated. All these factors are found based on the existing literature and our interview data.

Contributions and Implications
This research contributes to the literature by providing new conceptual framework on how organizational factors interact with the emergence of serial innovators based on the evidence from collectivistic culture, Japan. This could be beneficial to generalize the findings in this area to be more applicable to different cultures. This research also contributes to practice with additional insights for senior managers and policy makers on how to encourage radical innovation.","Griffin, A., Price, R., Vojak, B. and Hoffman, N.

The extant research on the attributes of serial innovators covers such aspects as technical creativity, marketing creativity, political skills and project management skills (e.g., Sim et al., 2007; Griffin, Price and Vojak, 2012). However, these skills and capabilities are mostly regarded as innate.
In contrast, this study proposes to focus more on intrapersonal diversity which can be accumulated through various experiences before and during the innovation processes. We also hypothesize that intrapersonal diversity has a positive effect on individual performance (Albert, 2008).
Since no study has been done to explain the relationship between intrapersonal diversity and the emergence of serial innovators, this research will shed a new light to enrich this research area. Furthermore, an evidence from Japanese firms with collectivistic culture will deepen the understanding on how to manage serial innovators in the international NPD contexts.
Brief literature mapping and key references
Since its introduction of the concept of serial innovators, both conceptual and empirical studies have been accumulated in the past decade. Serial innovators are defined as those who can continuously lead innovations even in a mature large firm (Griffin, Price and Vojak, 2012; Griffin et al., 2014).
In particular, serial innovators can create break through innovations rather than incremental ones. They can solve critical issues for people, organizations and society more than once in their company life.
In the past studies, skills and capabilities required for serial innovators were regarded as innate and therefore, hiring such people was discussed as a critical issue for utilizing the power of serial innovators.
On the other hand, intrapersonal diversity which means accumulated various experiences has been discussed as one of the essential factors for innovators (Albert, 2008). intrapersonal diversity has been found to have a positive effect on individual performance, however, no study has investigated its effect on the emergence of serial innovators.
Approach and Methodology
This research consists of both quantitative and qualitative approach. In January and February 2016, a quantitative survey was sent to Japanese manufacturers to find serial innovators. Then from August to December 2016, 39 semi-structured interviews were conduced at 21 companies. The industries of the respondents were diverse including pharmaceutical, beverage,
apparel, cosmetics, metal, etc. The total length of the interviews reached 1642 hours.
The transcription of the interviews was independently analyzed by three researchers of this project. During the process, we found this key construct, intrapersonal diversity, which had not been studied in the literature.
Contributions and Implications
Based on the interviews with serial innovators and their colleagues around them in Japan, we have found that intrapersonal diversity is one of the key factors. In other words, if the individuals are highly diverse from what they had accumulated through their past experiences, the more likely the person can be a serial innovator.
This study can contribute to the academics in twofold. First, proposing a new factor, intrapersonal diversity, will enrich the concept and framework of serial innovators. Second, this research adds new evidence from a collectivistic country and will help generalize the theory to be more applicable to other cultures.
Practically, this research suggests that, not only hiring a talented person as a serial innovator but also providing environment such as in-house trainings and job rotations for exposing individuals to other experiences can enhance the emergence level of serial innovators more systematically.","Cannella Jr., Albert.

"KHRAISHI, AHMAD ","PAULRAJ, ANTONY","HUQ, FAHIAN",,,,,OFFSHORE OUTSOURCING INNOVATION IN SMES: THE ART OF COLLABORATION WITH STRANGERS,12 - Networks and Alliances in New Product Development,"Despite extensive research and general scholarly agreement that complementary capabilities of the dyad is essential to successful outsourcing innovation collaborations, the role of complementary capabilities of the dyad remains underexplored in the case of offshore outsourcing innovation (OOI) in SMEs (Gusenbauer et al., 2015, Musteen and Ahsan, 2013). Our interest is in tracing complementary capabilities of the dyad's role in these exchanges.
When applied in the context of OOI in SMEs, complementary capabilities of the dyad can act as a shift parameter towards adopting OOI given that SMEs have no room internally for highly expensive investments in innovation (De Vita et al., 2010, Spithoven and Teirlinck, 2015). Typically however, SMEs find their greatest shortcomings in combining internal and external knowledge and expertise and in building and coordinating long term interfirm relationships (van de Vrande et al., 2009).
In SMEs, OOI is conssistent with the relational view (Dyer and Singh, 1998); which sees SMEs engage OOI strategies to substitute for in-house deficiencies in innovation resources and capabilities. Also, abiding the rationale of the extended resource based view, SMEs manage to gain competitive advantage through leveraging their relational capability to establish and coordinate OOI relationships despite their lack of ownership and control over their offshore suppliers valuable innovation resources (Lavie, 2006).This is in contrast with large firms which prefer to internalise all innovation resources , or utilise OOI to complement their internal innovation activities (Lewin et al., 2009, Stanko and Calantone, 2011). Therefore, constrained with their limited resources, SMEs are usually a weak representation of the focal firm in dyadic or network alliances (Albors-Garrigos et al., 2011, Julien, 1993). SMEs often have access to a smaller pool of small or less specialised suppliers to choose form than in the case large firms (Koufteros et al., 2012, Mindruta et al., 2016). Moreover, they have limited capacity in terms of the number of OOI relationships they can afford to

Offshore Outsourcing Innovation in SMEs
establish and continue (Mitsuhashi and Greve, 2009). Thus, notwithstanding their limited choices and chances in finding the right offshore supplier and location for their OOI endeavour, little is known about how SMEs learn to master the art of collaboration with strangers in OOI relationships (Gusenbauer, Massini and Fink, 2015, Mitsuhashi and Greve, 2009).
In this study we aim to delineate why supplier’s asset specificity and goal compatibility predict complimentary capabilities of the dyad, and how complementary capabilities of the dyad might affect performance of OOI in SMEs. To test our proposed model we collected date from 200 developed country European SME manufacturers.
Our study intend to contribute to SMEs and outsourcing innovation theories by conceptualising and examining OOI in SMEs from the theoretical perspective of the relational view (Dyer and Singh, 1998) and the extended resource based view (Lavie, 2006). Our empirical model provides concepts linking OOI performance in SMEs to antecedents and impacts of dyadic complementarity. We argue that SMEs’ OOI relationships that are characterised with high goal compatibility and in which the offshore supplier contributes specific assets can achieve complementary relational rent. We also show how this dyadic complementarity mediates the impact of those factors in influencing the overall OOI performance. Therefore, we empirically contribute to the OOI management literature in SMEs. Finally, we add to our understanding about how SMEs and large firms are different","Albors-Garrigos, J., Etxebarria, N.Z., Hervas-Oliver, J.L. and Epelde, J.G. (2011).

"KLEIN, SASCHA ","SCHNEIDER, SABRINA","SPIETH, PATRICK",,,,,SOCIAL BUSINESS MODELS: RIGID AND FLEXIBLE CONSEQUENCES OF STRATEGIC CHOICES,"19 - Social, Frugal and BoP Innovation","Social businesses have the mission to solve social issues by creating social value, while striving for commercial activities to fund themselves. Besides increasing practical occurrence and relevance, these organizations provide an interesting avenue for research on innovative hybrid organizations regarding the consequences of combining different institutional logics (Battilana and Lee 2014). To date, a number of studies on hybrids propose several typologies of social businesses and investigate the tensions caused by institutional plurality. Despite possible tensions, the combination of institutional logics can also act as an enabler of innovation and new organizational mechanisms (Jay 2013). Although recent research identifies value drivers of social business models (BMs) (Spieth et al. 2018), the extent to which concrete consequences of strategic choices in social businesses interact and reinforce each other, remains poorly understood and lacks empirical proof.
Therefore, this study seeks to explore strategic choices and aims to identify (rigid and flexible) consequences due to pluralistic institutional logics. By applying the choices and consequences logic of BMs proposed by Casadesus-Masanell and Ricart (2010) we conduct a qualitative research design with a multiple case study comprising a purposeful sampling strategy.
We account for information-rich cases by identifying firms with clearly articulated social missions (e.g. by scanning website, annual reports) in order to derive patterns for fundamental choices and consequences of hybrids. The sample comprises more than 20 social businesses, with ongoing data collection in the next few weeks until we reach theoretical saturation. Preliminary data analysis reveals emerging patterns of choices and consequences that are influenced by the underlying values. However, cross-case analysis shows different implications for rigidity (e.g. the choice to collaborate only with partners that share the same values) and flexibility of the consequences depending on the priority level of social value generation. Furthermore, we identified path dependencies and feedback loops due to the priority assigned either to commercial or social value logic. Thus, new opportunities for further value creation (commercial as well as social) and BM innovation may result from these peculiarities. Interestingly, the
data reveals that hybrids that generate social value automatically by selling their product or service to customers that are also the beneficiaries of the social value show different feedback loops than those firms that differentiate between customers and beneficiaries.
With the identification of feedback loops and path dependencies as well as rigid and flexible consequences, we respond to several calls for investigating configurations of hybrids (Battilana, Lee 2014) that combine different institutional value logics for value capturing (Laasch, 2017) and extend previous research on flexibility of hybrids (Smith and Besharov 2017) and value drivers of social BMs (Spieth et al. 2018). A better understanding of the choices and consequences in hybrids also helps managers of both – social businesses as well as commercial businesses: First, managers in social enterprises can learn how to align social value generation with commercial activities efficiently. Second, it helps managers of commercial firms to realize the consequences of their decisions, when a commercial firm aims to generate social value.","Battilana, Julie; Lee, Matthew (2014): Advancing Research on Hybrid Organizing – Insights from the Study of Social Enterprises.

"KO, GUIHAN ","ROBERTS, DEBORAH ","PERKS, HELEN",,,,,APPLYING THE RIGHT CUSTOMER CO-CREATION ACTIVITIES IN THE FUZZY FRONT END OF NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,16 - Organising New Product Development,"Customer co-creation activities are increasingly carried out by firms as a means to generate valuable knowledge for the innovation process and enhance overall new product development (NPD) success (Mahr, Lievens, and Blazevic, 2014). The 2010 European Community Innovation Study reported 27% of firms in the EU collaborate with customers (Eurostat, 2013). Customer co-creation involves outsourcing critical innovation tasks to the customer to generate and evaluate new product offerings (O’Hern and Rindfleisch, 2010). Studies have suggested that, in doing so, the firm must empower customers involved in the process (e.g., Hoyer, Chandy, Dorotic, Krafft, and Singh, 2010; Fuchs and Schreier, 2011).
Despite extensive scholarly and professional interest, little research is dedicated to understanding the effectiveness and firm-based benefits of using co-creation activities, especially in the context of the early Fuzzy Front End (FFE) of NPD. This research seeks to assess how co-creation activities affect, firstly, the creativity of initial concepts in the FFE and, secondly, early performance of the NPD process.
Drawing on research gaps identified by Gemser and Perks (2015), the research integrates both the user innovation perspective (e.g., Ogawa and Piller, 2006), and relationship strategy perspective (e.g., Ranjan and Read, 2014; Chang and Taylor, 2016) in conceptualizing, characterizing and operationalizing customer co-creation activities. Specifically, co-creation is portrayed and categorized into generation and evaluation activities, adapting existing characterizations (Lubart, 2001; Eling et al., 2014).
To address the research aims, a conceptual framework is developed, together with hypothesized relationships. The hypotheses are tested vis-à-vis the relationships between customer co-creation activities and fuzzy front end performance. Measures of the core constructs are carefully developed and validated. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 205 medium and large sized firms with experience of customer co-creation in the FFE of NPD and located in the UK and the US. The model was carefully assessed by using Seemingly Unrelated Regression (SUR).
3
The results highlight that the deployment of customer co-creation activities is positively related to the development of highly creative concepts in the FFE of NPD. Additionally, the results demonstrate the FFE effect and utilization of different types of co-creation techniques. They show that firms are more likely to utilize crowd-based co-creation activities, such as idea contests or crowdsourcing, in generating ideas and concepts. On the other hand, in evaluating ideas and concepts, firms are more likely to use dyadic co-creation activities, such as co-creation workshops for screening product concepts.
Thus, this study’s contribution lies in providing empirical evidence for the positive effect of deployment of co-creation activities on the effectiveness of the front end of NPD. It shows how this effect is derived from higher creativity of new product concepts. For NPD managers, the research gives valuable insights into the way specific types of customer co-creation activities affect the FFE. This can support targeted investments in specific types of co-creation practices aligned to particular tasks of the early NPD process.","Eling, K., Griffin, A., & Langerak, F. (2014).

"KO, GUIHAN ","GARCIA, MARIAN",,,,,,FOSTERING THE GENERATION OF CREATIVE SOLUTIONS IN CROWDSOURCING COMMUNITIES: CO-OPETITION IN DISCUSSION FORUMS,08 - Managing Knowledge and Information Systems in New Product Development,"Crowdsourcing platforms are largely based on an open competition model where a firm identifies a task or group of tasks, currently being performed in-house, and outsource it to undefined network of people, referred to as the ‘crowd’ (Howe, 2008). Competitive pressures for the best solution drive solvers to keep trying new ideas (Bullinger et al., 2010; Garcia Martinez and Walton, 2014). Furthermore, the paradox of cooperation and collaboration remains a prominent research area in organisational and strategy research (Bengtsson and Kock, 2014; Dorn et al., 2016). The increasing interest in business ecosystems has led to the evolution of the concept of ‘co-opetition’ from an inter-firm level to a network-level (e.g., Hutter et al., 2011).
The research literature in crowdsourcing communities suggests that a co-opetitive setting where solvers simultaneously collaborate and compete enhances innovation and creativity (Gnyawali and Park, 2011; Ritala and Hurmelinna-Laukkanen, 2009; Shih et al., 2006). Platforms’ community functionalities foster collaborative and supportive behaviours among solvers while they compete to submit the best solutions to win the contest. These collaboration capabilities allow solvers to socialise crowdsourcing request requirements and suggest or ask for problem solutions in real time, which in turn advance the development of creativity, solutions and innovations (Blohm et al., 2011; Hutter et al., 2011; Haavisto, 2014). Hence, a combination of competition and collaboration – co-opetition, coexist in the elaboration of creative solutions by the crowd, making crowdsourcing competitions an interesting research setting (Bullinger et al., 2010; Kathan et al., 2015).
However, very few studies have focused on competition design characteristics that may contribute to enhancing the effectiveness of crowdsourcing strategies, particularly whether cooperation tools in the competitive settings of open call crowdsourcing competitions influence creative performance (e.g., Blohm et al., 2011).
2
Therefore, this paper aims at expanding the understanding of crowdsourcing by investigating how crowdsourcing platforms’ features that favour collaboration among solvers influence solvers’ search process, and consequently, the related problem solving performance. Specifically, we investigate if the level of enhanced communication and interaction as well as sentiment supported by online discussion forums, as indicated by posts and views affects solvers’ creative performance in terms of solution quality and quantity. This study utilizes the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) text-analytics software as well as Hierarchical Linear Modelling (HLM) to investigate text data and relevant information from a well known crowdsourcing platform.
We expect this research expands the spectrum of coopetition literature in individual and network level under crowdsourcing context by answering previous research calls (Dorn et al., 2016; Majchrzak and Malhortra 2013). Finally, we argue that co-opetition among solvers provides a positive climate for creative behaviour assuming the level of intelligence in a team all equal. A setting of competition and collaborative community supports a social environment full of encouragement, challenge and support; all social factors considered in theories of organisational creativity and innovation identity as enablers of creativity (Amabile et al., 1996; Kanter, 1988).","AMABILE, T.

"KOK, ROBERT","FU, YAO","LIGTHART, PAUL E.M.","VAN RIEL, ALLARD C.R.","DANKBAAR, BEN",,,THE EFFECTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS ON SUSTAINABLE MANAGERIAL AND TECHNICAL RESPONSE BEHAVIOR OF FIRMS: THE ROLE OF REGULATORY UNCERTAINTY AND INFORMATION TRANSPARENCY,10 - Managing Sustainability in Innovation and Product Development,"With the aim to better understand the conditions under which firms respond to environmental regulations, we investigate how regulatory uncertainty and information transparency influence the effectiveness of environmental regulations on the adoption of managerial and technical sustainable practices. The demand for sustainable firm behavior frequently takes the form of environmental regulation (Del Rio et al., 2011, Demirel and Kesidou, 2011, Luken et al., 2008, Sangle, 2011, Veugelers, 2012, Weng and Lin, 2011). Without environmental regulation, investments in the development and diffusion of sustainable technologies would likely be below a socially desirable level (Jaffe et al., 2005). However, even though most studies confirm a positive effect of environmental regulation on sustainable behavior of firms, some studies found no significant effects or even a negative effect on sustainable process technology adoption under specific circumstances (e.g., Bonilla et al., 2015, Borghesi et al., 2015a, Lofgren et al., 2014, Popp, 2010, Triguero et al., 2015, Triguero et al., 2013). Consequently, the effectiveness of environmental regulations is questioned by researchers. For example, by encouraging some sustainable technologies, environmental regulation may push other superior technologies out of the market (Jaffe et al., 2005). Moreover, conflicting and overlapping policies and policy instruments cause confusion, complexity and higher costs to firms, which may result in negative effects on firms’ adoption behavior (Borghesi et al., 2015b, Chappin et al., 2009). Consequently, environmental regulations may not always be effective in changing organizations’ sustainable behavior, depending on the regulatory context and the type of behavior.
Combining evolutionary and institutional theory, we hypothesized that regulatory uncertainty has a negative and information transparency has a positive effect on the impact of environmental regulations on technical distinguished from managerial sustainable behavior. The hypotheses are tested using survey data of 603 Chinese and 155 Dutch manufacturing firms. Our structural equation modelling results show that policy awareness is significantly related to technical sustainable practices, while policy enforcement is significantly related to both managerial and technical sustainable practices. Regulatory uncertainty negatively moderates both the relationship between policy awareness and managerial sustainable practices and the relationship between policy enforcement and technical sustainable practices.

Information transparency only positively moderates the effect of policy enforcement on technical sustainable practices.
This paper explains the underlying mechanisms of the impact of environmental regulations on firms’ sustainable behavior, emphasizing the importance of not only the policy itself but also the regulatory context. This study contributes to organizational adoption theory and innovation literature by disentangling managerial and technical practices. Regarding the ecological aspect of sustainable development, prior studies capture only part of the picture of organizational innovation. The distinction between managerial behavior and technical practices portrays a wide range of organizational tasks, which is more comprehensive to describe organizational sustainable activities. It contributes to institutional theory suggesting heterogeneous response conditions towards institutional pressures and contributes to organizational sustainable behavior studies by finding different effects with respect to managerial and technical sustainable practices.
For firm managers it implies that environmental regulation mainly undertakes two responsibilities: first as a signal for legitimacy, and second as a measure for punishing or rewarding. So, they have to consider that these two responsibilities do have different impact on different types of firms’ sustainable behavior, managerial and technical practices, and also depend on the regulatory context that may differ in information transparency and regulatory uncertainty. Thus, this study provides an alternative perspective in analyzing compliance with environmental regulations.","Bonilla, J., J. Coria, K. Mohlin and T. Sterner 2015.

"KOK, ROBERT","FU, YAO","LIGTHART, PAUL E.M.","VAN RIEL, ALLARD C.R.","DANKBAAR, BEN",,,WHAT INFLUENCES MANUFACTURING FIRMS TO ADOPT SUSTAINABLE PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES? - THE RELATIVE IMPORTANCE OF ECONOMIC AND INSTITUTIONAL DRIVERS,10 - Managing Sustainability in Innovation and Product Development,"This paper investigates the drivers affecting the adoption of sustainable process technologies by manufacturing firms. Governments worldwide are stimulating firms to save energy and materials and reduce environmental pollution. Also, local communities, NGOs and mass media are increasingly environmentally active (Yang and Calhoun, 2007). While many firms have seized the opportunity to gain competitive advantages by being more sustainable (Esty and Winston, 2006, p10-13), adoption rates of sustainable technologies are low, leaving great potential to save energy and to reduce pollutants (Birkin et al., 2009, Palcic et al., 2013, Short et al., 2012).
From an economic perspective, some studies claim that it pays to be green (e.g., Molina-Azorín et al., 2009, Orlitzky et al., 2003, Russo and Fouts, 1997), while other studies were inconclusive (e.g., Keele and DeHart, 2011, Kevin et al., 2004, Link and Naveh, 2006, Pons et al., 2013). This suggests that economic benefits are not always strong enough to induce the adoption of sustainable technologies. In that case, institutional pressure is essential through its role in creating legitimacy (Bansal and Roth, 2000, Tolbert and Zucker, 1983), but also has its limits. While environmental regulations can raise firms’ awareness, motivate them to innovate, ensure environmental investment is rewarding, or signal the inefficient use of resources and potential technology improvement (Porter and Van der Linde, 1995), they do not provide incentives to go beyond the required standards and will gradually become obsolete or even counterproductive (Montalvo, 2008). Similarly, other institutional pressures, such as mimetic pressures from peer organizations and normative pressure from mass media, local communities, and professionalization may also affect sustainable development (e.g. Popp et al., 2011).
Distinguishing economic from institutional theoretical explanations of firms’ adoption behavior and classifying sustainable process technologies according to their cost-saving potentials, we hypothesize that economic drivers and institutional drivers are both relevant for the adoption of sustainable technologies, but economic drivers are more important for cost-decreasing sustainable process technologies, and institutional drivers are more important for cost-increasing sustainable process technologies. Additionally, we hypothesize synergy effects between economic and institutional drivers.
Based on a survey of manufacturing firms in China and The Netherlands with 768 valid cases, our hierarchical regression results show that policy awareness, society pressure and peer organizations’ adoption are significant drivers for the adoption of cost-increasing technologies, while policy awareness, peer organizations’ adoption and customer demand
2
are significant drivers for the adoption of cost-decreasing technologies. Policy awareness has the most important effect on the adoption of either type of sustainable process technology. However, in terms of economic drivers, only customer demand is associated with cost-decreasing sustainable technology adoption. Instead of the expected synergy effects between economic and institutional drivers, we find only complementary effects. Overall, multiple pathways affect firms’ sustainable technology adoption, even though they do not work synergistically.
This study contributes to the innovation literature and adoption theory by investigating more comprehensively the impact of institutional pressures, suggesting that an adoption process could be first legitimated. In addition, this study contributes to sustainable technology adoption literature by exploring the different underlying mechanisms for the adoption of two types of sustainable process technologies – cost-increasing and cost-decreasing sustainable technologies – from the perspective of the relative importance of different driving forces and synergy effects between drivers. This implies for managers as well as policy makers to strive for alignment of polices and economic conditions to facilitate the adoption of sustainable process technologies.","Bansal, P. and K.

"EDA KOP, AYSEGUL",,,,,,,HOW SOCIAL MEDIA CHANNELS CAN BE USED DURING NPD BY B2B AND B2C COMPANIES,15 - Open Innovation,"One of the most important stages of a manufacturing process starts with designing the product according to the customers’ needs in the innovation process. Collaborating with customers during the NPD process enables companies to meet customers’ needs better. To achieve this, companies have to conduct their market research more deeply to understand and determine customers’ needs (Goffin and Lemke, 2004). However, the abilities of customers` contribution to the NPD is a dilemma in the literature (Bradley 2003; Bonner and Walker 2004).
Goffin and Lemke (2004) emphasize that although listening customers’ voice is essential for the NPD, the way of listening customers has been changed. One of the ways that companies use during their NPD process is social media. The usage social media for innovating new products become an efficient way because of its possible benefits in addition to its help to make salient new product decisions before launching the product (Naylor, Lamberton, & West, 2012, Dahl et al., 2011, Björk and Magnusson, 2009). However, the difference between B2B and B2C companies and influence of Social media on incremental and radical innovations are much under understood.
Therefore, the following key research questions are proposed. Key research questions
- To what extent Social media can be used for gathering ideas from consumers?
- How do the results contribute to NPD and its success?
2
Methodology
In this research, both primary and secondary data have been collected from the companies. This research aims to start with qualitative methods such as interviews and observations. For the primary data, information has been collected from the company staff from various departments by in-depth face-to-face interviews. The sample for this research has been chosen among the innovative companies. This research is based on a research through social media. Because of that, a sample of companies have been identified according to which (i) behave actively in social media pages (ii) consider these pages for their innovation decisions, (iii) agree to participate to this research. In addition to the primary data, company’s social media pages, annual reports, investor reports and R&D reports have been used as secondary data. After the analysis and evaluations of interviews, observations and secondary sources, how and to what extent companies can use social media have been determined. Thematic analysis has been used to analyse the data by using NVivo.
Findings
This research proposal aims to examine how the innovative companies use information from the customers through social media pages of companies for determining customers’ needs for their new products. Also, it will evaluate using social media for incremental/radical innovation, in comparing with the traditional methods by B2B and B2C companies.
Significance of the Research
This paper is significant because the analysis of consumer contribution to NPD through SM and its efficiency is still a gap in the literature. To address this research gap, this paper aims to find how companies identify customers’ needs for NPD by using social media. This paper will contribute to the literature with the evaluation of the collaboration of social media users to find customers’ needs.","Björk, J. and Magnusson, M.

"KROH, JULIA ","SCHULTZ, CARSTEN",,,,,,IS STAKEHOLDER INTEGRATION A MEAN TO COPE WITH COMPLEXITY IN URBAN INNOVATION?,15 - Open Innovation,"Urban innovations in the sense of innovative urban restructuring differ tremendously from well-known innovation types like product, process, and service innovation, because they are necessarily realized in a city’s complex and adaptive (eco)system (Mieg, 2012). For example, implementing innovative district heating grids and offering car sharing services to create a new mobility infrastructure call for the acceptance and adoption of various locally established stakeholders like firms and residents. The objective of this research is therefore to investigate stakeholder integration as a mean to cope with urban innovations’ complexity.
Within an urban (eco)system different public and private actors interact in complex and non-linear ways for urban innovation (Gopalakrishnan and Damanpour, 1994; Katz, 2006). Project teams that develop urban innovation alternatives therefore need to be diverse and develop heterogeneous innovation alternatives that fit the specific urban requirements. Recent research shows that stakeholder integration is necessary to achieve high performance in such complex innovation processes (e.g., Juntunen et al., 2018), because the integration of stakeholders helps to cope with and profit from complexity by for example, creating new business and application possibilities (Dougherty and Dunne, 2011). However, integrating heterogeneous stakeholders in urban innovations may require compromises as the individual objectives of each stakeholder may contradict each other. Further, the involvement of a broad set of stakeholders leads to coordination challenges and an increasing formalization of information and decision processes, both with downsides for efficiency and efficacy. This is especially true for innovation processes that require the integration of the public sector (Torugsa and Arundel, 2016). As such, we suggest that stakeholder integration is a double-sided sword, in particular with regard to the degree of innovativeness of the developed and implemented solutions. Nevertheless, a high degree of innovativeness of urban innovation is important, as for example, the application of new technologies are the fundament for addressing the current ecological needs of cities. To the best of our knowledge, this complex relationship between stakeholder integration and innovativeness is not clarified yet.
We analyze the relationship between the level of complexity of urban innovation projects, the intensity of stakeholder integration, and the degree of innovativeness of the developed solutions by using a unique data set of a German public funded urban innovation initiative. We measure the complexity of the urban innovations as the degree of project team diversity, the heterogeneity of urban innovation goals, and alternatives. The innovativeness of 101 concepts from this urban innovation initiative was measured based on text mining. Survey data on stakeholder integration in these innovation projects was added. The concepts describe selected innovation alternatives, which the team, consisting of, e.g., public administration, energy providers, and housing companies, suggests for implementation in a specific urban environment. Hence, this study focuses on the front end of urban innovation. The overall objective of the initiative is the same for all project teams, so the list of potential innovation alternatives is constant.
First results of the regression analysis show a direct effect of complexity on innovativeness, which is in line with previous literature from other innovation fields. For example, team diversity is shown to positively influence innovativeness (e.g., Talke et al., 2011). The relationship between stakeholder integration and innovativeness follows an inverted U shaped pattern: An increase from low to moderate integration intensity leads to a higher innovativeness, because of a more diverse idea generation process. But as previous literature suggests, an increase from moderate to high integration intensity reveals negative consequences when it comes to the degree of innovativeness (Garcia-Castro and Francoeur, 2016, Watson et al., 2017).
This research thus helps to understand stakeholder integration as a mean for innovativeness in urban innovation, thereby extending our knowledge about the negative consequences of a highly open innovation approach and by exploring the specific requirements of urban innovation.","Mieg, H.

"KRUFT, TOBIAS ","KOCK, ALEXANDER",,,,,,"BEHAVIORAL CHANGE OF INNOVATION CLIMATE: HOW EMPLOYEE-FOCUSED, CENTRALIZED INNOVATION ACTIVITIES CAN IMPROVE INNOVATION CLIMATE IN THE WHOLE COMPANY.",01. Creativity in New Product Development,"The working climate in companies is a crucial component of how employees perform their work. In particular, the innovation climate has a very strong influence on the innovation behavior of individuals since it can nip any innovation in the bud or directly foster even the weakest ideas in their development (Büschgens, Bausch, and Balkin 2013; Hogan and Coote 2014; Zhu, Gardner, and Chen 2018). Currently, many corporate incubators are emerging which, among many other goals, aim to improve the innovation climate of the hosting company over the long term by changing the mindset of the employees in a bottom-up approach (Magadley and Birdi 2009; Kohler 2016; Kruft, Gamber, and Kock 2018). Advocates of Lewinian theory often argue that supervisors generate climate in a top-down approach which in turn affect the employees behavior (Lewin 1951; Denison 1996). In fact, supervisors are a crucial factor in influencing the climate and innovation (Zhang and Bartol 2010). However, Lewinian Theory does not allow employees to influence the climate themselves (Denison 1996) which theoretically deprives an organization of many opportunities to adequately influence the climate, for example through workshops, events or other centralized activities employees can attend. Yet more and more, it is precisely such activities that corporate incubators praise in order to shape the corporate climate to become more innovative in the long term.
This paper examines the influence of employees’ behavioral changes on the innovation climate of their department by participating in centralized innovation activities of corporate incubators. As a theoretical basis we use symbolic interaction perspective (Mead 1934) and social construction perspective (Berger and Luckmann 1966) which, unlike the Lewinian Theory, assume that employees of social systems are best regarded as being agents and subjects of innovation climate simultaneously (Denison 1996) which enables to investigate the influence of the employees’ behavior on their working climate.
We hypothesize that corporate incubators influence the participating individuals’ mindset through centralized activities such as workshops and events. The employees in turn spread this mindset in their working environment after the end of the activity and therefore affect the innovation climate of their department. To test our hypotheses, we use a multi-level
longitudinal two-stage least squares (2SLS) regression with 1,200 participants nested in 100 organizational units of a large, international science and technology company with several instrument variables for each activity in order to avoid selection-bias.
Results show that several activities of corporate incubators are capable of affecting the innovation climate of the hosting company’s departments. This way, we shed light on this still unexplored field of climate & incubator research especially on innovation climate change through behavior. The results ensure that centralized activities of corporate incubators can reach employees who are not directly affected by the incubator themselves. Managers can use centralized innovation activities in order to affect the innovation climate of the whole company in the long run.","Berger, P. L., and T. Luckmann. 1966.

"KRUFT, TOBIAS ","KOCK, ALEXANDER",,,,,,OPPORTUNISM IN CORPORATE IDEATION PLATFORMS: ANALYZING THE SUCCESS OF IDEATORS’ SUBMISSION STRATEGIES,01. Creativity in New Product Development,"Companies often use ideation contests to identify and promote ideas among their employees. So far, research has increasingly investigated the mechanisms of ideation processes and acceptance as well as the ideators’ motivation to participate (Piezunka and Dahlander 2015; Coussement, Debaere, and De Ruyck 2017; Criscuolo et al. 2017; Beretta 2018). Research also raised awareness of the importance of collaboration in idea contests (Björk and Magnusson 2009; Deichmann and Jensen 2018; Zhu et al. 2018). At the same time first insights emerge on deviant participant behavior in crowdsourcing (Gatzweiler, Blazevic, and Piller 2017). In this context, we still lack information about ideators’ submission and collaboration strategies, in particular, whether opportunistic behavior outperforms the advantages of collaboration in teams or even those of elaborate ideas in terms of idea success.
To address this issue, we identified four teamwork and four submission strategies based on two continuous dimensions each. The teamwork strategies result from the ideator’s intensity to discuss their own idea with others and how strongly ideators internalize the ideas of others. The two submission strategy’s dimensions are the number of ideas submitted to this contest and the quality they have dedicated to each idea. We hypothesize that, in the pre-selection phase, non-opportunistic collaboration strategies determine ideas’ success while ideators benefit from opportunistic behavior in terms of idea submission. We further hypothesize that non-opportunistic submission strategies gain in value during the selection process.
We test our hypotheses with a unique data set which combines platform and evaluation data of an R&D ideation contest with survey data of participants received a few days before the closure of the contest. The platform data encompasses 932 multi-ideator ideas submitted by 1,097 ideators who are represented by 358 ideators in the survey data. The evaluation data encompasses 131 experts with a total of 4,115 evaluations in a four-stage selection process. We measure success whether an ideator was able to push at least one idea into the next stage.
Results from logistic regression analysis show that both opportunistic and collaborative teamwork strategies can be successful while opportunistic strategies outperform quality-oriented submission strategies in the pre-selection phase. In the later stages, quality-oriented submission strategies gain in value, although some opportunistic strategies remain successful.
This study contributes to innovation literature by providing a better understanding of ideators’ submission- and teamwork-behavior in idea contests. Managers can use these findings to deliberately adapt incentive mechanisms as well as providing targeted support for the ideators in order to improve an idea contest’s outcome. Since not all opportunistic strategies are bad per se, the results can also encourage employees to pursue alternative strategies while managers support them in doing so.","Beretta, M. 2018.

"KUSTRAK KORPER, ANA","PATRÍCIO, LIA","HOLMLID, STEFAN","WITELL, LARS",,,,BUILDING DYNAMIC CAPABILITIES THROUGH SERVICE DESIGN IN TECHNOLOGY-DRIVEN COMPANIES: A MULTIPLE CASE STUDY,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"To find a new source of competitiveness, many technology-driven companies are
turning to service innovation. However, transition from technology to innovative
service solutions is far more complex than bundling technology and services and
delivering them to the intended target market. Whereas technology-push often
dominates innovation perspectives in technology-driven companies, service
innovation requires a more systemic perspective focused on how customer
experiences are co-created. Integrating a service perspective in technology-driven
companies entails understanding complex service systems consisting of people,
technology and information (Akaka, Vargo, & Schau, 2015; Maglio, Kwan, & Spohrer,
2015; Spohrer & Maglio, 2008). Complex systems of value co-creation necessitates
exploration of human-centered approaches to innovation and facilitation of actors’
participation and engagement (Payne, Storbacka, & Frow, 2008). Service design can
address these complexities in a holistic, systemic and human-centered way (Patrício,
Gustafsson, & Fisk, 2018). Service design is defined as a human-centered and holistic
perspective to designing for service innovation embedded in multi-actor service
systems (Patrício et al., 2011, Holmlid & Evenson, 2008). Empirical studies often focus
on its role in the innovation process and contribute by establishing new service
design models (Grenha Teixeira et al., 2017; Grenha Teixeira et al., 2012; Patrício et al.,
2011). Although some studies point to challenges of service design integration in
building design capability (Holmlid & Malmberg, 2018), little is known about how
service design influence the development of capabilities in technology-driven
companies employing technology-push approaches to innovation (Patrício,
Gustafsson, & Fisk, 2018).
This study investigates how service design can aid technology-driven companies to
build capabilities in service innovation. Using a framework for dynamic capabilities, it
aims to understand how and why service design influences technology-driven
companies’ competitive position. To this end, we use the dynamic capability
framework as the theoretical lens to understand innovation from adaptive and
systemic perspective (Helfat & Peteraf, 2009; Teece, 2007), as it describes how
opportunities are sensed and seized and resources reconfigured (Teece, 2007). This
framework is important for technology-driven companies innovating through service
design because it can extend the insights into what capabilities service design brings
in reconfiguring the the service systems improve its competitiveness.
To understand how technology-driven companies use service design in their
innovation processes, and how service design enables the development of dynamic
capabilities, this research uses a multiple case study methodology. Case selection
includes seven established international companies with strong technology
component that have at least three-year experience working with service design.
Through in-depth semi-structured interviews, observation and archival
documentation, rich data was collected and analyzed to answer the research
questions.
Preliminary findings suggest there are different ways how organizations integrate
service design for innovation depending on the interplay between individual and
institutional activities. This is also reflected in microfoundations in each stage of the
dynamic capability framework. Although service design was introduced on a projectbased
level, the exploratory and systemic nature of service design projects facilitated
sensing of innovation opportunities throughout the innovation process. In several
cases, this led to the establishment of service design practice as part of the
organization’s strategic positioning and it was manifested in the organizational
culture and routines of both design and non-design units. Whereas in short term
innovation process can benefit from service design tools and methods relevant for
sensing opportunities and threats, seizing and reconfiguring capabilities require
organizational integration of service design. This study contributes to the literature
by delineating dynamic capabilities related to service design. It also contributes to
broadening the framework towards service innovation facilitated by service design.

"LARSSON, LISA ","KARLSSON, ANNA",,,,,,ADOPTION AND IMPLEMENTATION OF SYSTEMIC INNOVATION IN PRODUCTION,"04 - Engineering, Production and Supply Issues in Innovation and Product Development","Innovation in production is, and will continue to be, an important competitive asset for many manufacturing firms. Underlying reasons for this is increasing global competition, the need for efficiency and productivity as well as a more sustainable production.
A production system can be described as a socio-technical system (Bellgran, 2010) consisting of, on the one hand, humans or groups of humans with common occupations and purposes, and on the other hand, artefacts created by technology. Because the different parts of a production system are dependent and intertwined with each other, innovation in production is often systemic. According to Chiesa et al (2011) systemic innovations require a significant readjustment of the other components in the system they are part of – as opposed to autonomous or stand-alone innovations which can be introduced without significantly modifying the rest of the system (Teece, 1984). To successfully commercialize a systemic innovation consequently requires changes to the system to which it belongs, sometimes causing impeding adoption behaviours. Innovations of a systemic nature can be expected to increase (Rohrbeck, 2013) also in production, not the least because e.g. many sustainability innovations and introduction of industrial Internet of Things (IoT) are systemic in their nature. Hence, how to succeed with the adoption and implementation of systemic production innovations is a key question today.
Innovation adoption and implementation is a well-researched topic, although different sectors may have unique characteristics influencing the process (Widen and Hansson, 2007), calling for industry specific studies. Many studies are founded in Roger’s (2003) diffusion of innovation theory, where five innovation attributes are identified which can help to explain 49% to 87% of the variance in the ratio of adoption of an innovation, these being: relative advantage, compatibility, complexity, trialability, and observability. Regarding diffusion of systemic innovations in organizations – which is the case when it comes to production innovations – the adoption and implementation process involves several individuals involved in different types of decision-making (Rogers, 2003). Many different players in the adoption network must consequently be convinced to support the innovation, thereby playing a central role in the success or failure of the commercialization (Chiesa et al, 2011). Also, the coordination of multiple actors is often required to adapt or change their processes and/or routines concurrently (Lindgren and Emmitt, 2017).
This paper investigates the link between the production side and the user side (Geels, 2004) of a production innovation – in this case how the adoption and implementation of a new radical manufacturing method was managed. Case study method was employed to explore the process of adoption and implementation from the innovating firm’s as well as the customers’ perspective. A mapping of Rogers five innovation attributes from both sides is conducted to identify the innovating firm’s strategies for easing adoption and implementation, as well as corresponding adoption behaviours at the user side. Preliminary results show e.g. that other actors within the system (but not in the supplier/customer relation) play a substantial role in the adoption of the innovation and actively involving these actors proved a successful strategy. The norms and traditions within the system also influence, and a deviation from these norms were perceived as negative, despite the increased relative advantage the innovation entailed. Due to
the significant influence a production innovation has on the system and vice versa, managers are encouraged to analyse and take into consideration these influences to tune the adoption and implementation strategies for better success.","Bellgran, M. & Säfsten K.

"LARSSON CARLANDER, MATHIAS","SKÖLD, MARTIN","MÄHRING, MAGNUS",,,,,INTERFACE MANAGEMENT IN NEW SERVITIZATION PROJECTS,18 - Service Innovation and New Service Development,"Problem discussion and theoretical framework. Digitalization and connected products
allow companies to develop offerings with an increased service content. This shift
towards more servitization is becoming an increasingly important part of future
competitiveness. To succeed, however, many companies need to apply novel types of
product content, for example software-based functionality, new to the firm’s R&D
environment, giving rise to new challenges. One is to ensure access to new technology
and knowledge. Another to integrate technologies of new and unknown character. Third,
ensure that new product content is supported in organizational structures, so that desired
output can be secured. Previous research has dealt partly with these issues (Karlsson
2003; Karlsson and Skold 2007; Parker, Van Alstyne, and Jiang 2016; Parker and Van
Alstyne 2018), identifying several key areas to address. One area is product platforms
and architectures as entities integrating components and technology. Another is
organizational and cultural challenges of technology integration. A third focuses on
hardware-software integration. Managerial challenges of old/new technology
intersections, so called interface management, are not satisfactory covered in previous
enquiries.
Purpose. The purpose of this study is to identify technological factors challenging
interface management in new servitization projects.
Methodology. The study relies on an explorative and clinical field-study of Alfa, a global
enterprise pursuing a servitization project. The unique opportunity promised access to indepth
and rich data appropriate to complement literature (Handfield & Melnyk, 1998).
The motive for choosing a single case study was traded in favor for the opportunity to
collect rich data in a natural setting (Åhlström, 1997; Åhlström & Karlsson, 2009).
Methods as participation, interviews, documents and protocols where chosen based on a
guiding research protocol.
Data. Alfa is a large OEM-enterprise developing, manufacturing, and assembling
complex products for professional customers. The case at focus, a global servitization
project, aimed to create a new service where customer owned products from Alfa was the
foundation to increase efficiency from joint product usage. The new servitization project
included means for both the user of the product and the product itself to support
collaboration. The creation of the new service gave rise to various new technological
interfaces for managers to address.
Analysis. The case illustrates many examples that Alfa’s existing product development
strategy and collaboration with suppliers can be viewed from a network perspective
(Karlsson 2003; Sköld and Karlsson 2012). Increased servitization and digitalization
created new and parallel sourcing hierarchies for both horizontal and vertical content that
managers did not have previous experiences how to manage. Open as well as specialized
technology in vertical and horizontal collaborations was identified with various interface
challenges to managers.
Synthesis and conclusions. The study shows that new servitization projects is a
challenging area for managers. One central reason is that new technology is sourced from
new and un-known actors. These actors are identified in vertical as well as horizontal
relations, also in totally new value-chains for the company. This gives rise to a huge
variety of technological interfaces that need management attention to succeed. Horizontal
interfaces seem to be more specific and company unique, whilst vertical interfaces are
more open and generic.","Åhlström, P. 1997. Sequences in the Process of Adopting Lean Production. Stockholm:

"LEE, RUBY","TANG, XINLIN",,,,,,HOW TO INCREASE INNOVATIVENESS AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY? THE ROLE OF PROCESS CAPABILITIES,"04 - Engineering, Production and Supply Issues in Innovation and Product Development","In today’s growing hypercompetitive environments, many firms often source from a diverse set of suppliers to obtain various components needed for a certain product or product to stay afloat. For instance, Boeing sources to hundreds of suppliers, such as Spirit Aerosystems, General Electric, and Goodrich, for its 787 Dreamliner. This example illustrates that many firms create a complicated and interdependent supplier portfolio for a specific product. Thus, understanding what process capabilities a firm can deploy to effectively manage its supplier portfolio for a given product and when such capabilities serve to improve competitive advantages (i.e., innovativeness and operational efficiency) (Porter, 1980) and subsequently, performance is a critical concern in theory and practice (e.g., Kibbeling et al., 2013).
This study focuses on two process capabilities, process alignment and partnering flexibility, that are crucial in helping firms leverage resources embedded in their suppliers (Tang and Rai, 2014). Process alignment reflects a firm’s ability to coordinate interdependent activities and optimize operations with a group of suppliers specific to a given product; whereas, partnering flexibility refers to a firm’s ability to add new and/or drop suppliers from an existing supplier portfolio to maintain agility.
Despite the importance of these two process capabilities, a large body of research (Flynn et al., 2010, Li et al., 2006) tends to not only examine them in isolation but also take a static view with an assumption that the impacts of these capabilities are constant over time. We challenge this assumption and argue that external forces are likely to play a role in changing the efficacy of process capabilities.
Drawing on the dynamic capabilities perspective and PLC literature, we examine how the growth vs. maturity stages of PLC affect (1) the individual and combined impacts of process alignment and partnering flexibility on operational efficiency and innovativeness, and (2) the impacts of operational efficiency and innovativeness on product market performance. Through a survey of 276 manufacturing firms, we find that process alignment affects more positively on operational efficiency when a product is in its growth rather than maturity stage, but its positive effect on innovativeness is indifferent across the PLC stages. In contrast, partnering flexibility exerts a stronger positive effect on operational efficiency but a weaker effect on innovativeness in the maturity rather than growth stage. The results further reveal that while their interaction effect has marginally significant and negative influence on operational efficiency in the maturity stage, such effect improves innovativeness in the growth stage. Moreover, operational efficiency and innovativeness influence product market performance in different ways, contingent upon the PLC stages. Our findings contribute to theory and practice by uncovering the changing roles of process capabilities across different PLC stages – showing the importance of studying process capabilities simultaneously and casting them in a dynamic setting (Patel and Husairi, 2018).","Flynn, B.B., Huo, B. and Zhao, X.

"LI, FENGSHU ","ANDRIES, PETRA",,,,,,THE EFFECT OF INNOVATION SUBSIDIES ON REGIONAL TRANSFORMATION:TAKING THE ECONOMIC TEXTURE INTO ACCOUNT,10 - Managing Sustainability in Innovation and Product Development,"It is generally accepted that technology innovation is crucial for the competitiveness and growth  of  enterprises,  regions  and  countries,  but  that  innovation  activities  are  typically characterized by market failures (Guellec and De La Potterie, 2003). Already since the 1980s, governments have been trying to correct these market failures by subsidizing R&D activities, resulting  in  higher  investments  in  R&D  as  well  as  scientific  and  technological  outputs  of R&D,  both  at  the  level  of  the  firm  and  the  region/country  (e.g.  Czarnitzki  and  Licht,  2006; Guo et al., 2018; Zhong et al., 2011; Doh and Kim, 2014). However,  although  increasing  R&D  investments  and  R&D  outputs  such  as  patents  and publications  is  important,  it  is  the  transformation  of  these  scientific  and  technological achievements into successful industrial or commercial applications that is crucial for reaping their economic value (Sejersen and Hansen,2018; Chen et al., 2018). This transformation can take   place   within   the   institution   that   generated   the   R&D   outputs   (e.g.   a   firm   that commercializes  an  internal  invention),  but  may  also  involve  the  transfer  of  scientific  and technological achievements from one institution to another (Grant, 2010; Bozeman, 2000).Initial  evidence  suggests  that  subsidies  can  positively  affect the  transformation  of scientific  and  technological  achievements  into  regional  economic value (Hong  et  al.,  2016). However, we know that not all types of firms have the same potential to commercialize new scientific/technological  achievements  and  will  hence  not  benefit  to  the  same  extent  from subsidies (Guo  et  al.,  2016).  Therefore,  this  study  argues  that  the relationship  between government  subsidies  in  a  given  region  and  the  transformation  of  scientific/technological achievements  into  economic  value  in  that  region  will  depend  on  the  regional  economic texture, and in particular on the average scale of the enterprises that are present there.Method and data:Our  study  uses  data  on  the high-tech  industry  of  27  provinces  and  cities  in  mainland China  during  2009-2015.We  use  the  DEA  model  (Charnes  et  al.,  1978)  to  calculate  the efficiency   of  the  two   stages   in   the   innovation   process,  i.e.  the   R&D   stage   and   the transformation  stage,  and  test  our  hypotheses  regarding  the  effect  of  subsidies  on  the efficiency  of  the  latter stage  by  using  the  nonlinear  panel  data  threshold  regression  model proposed  by  Hansen (1999);  the  average  enterprise  scale  in  the  region  being  the threshold variable.Conclusion and contribution:We find that the impact of government subsidies on the transformation of scientific and technological achievements in the high-tech industry has a significant double threshold effect Type your text
2of enterprise scale. When the scale of  enterprises in a region is small, government subsidies negatively  influence  the  transformation  of  scientific  and  technological  achievements  into economic  value.  This  negative  impact  weakens  and  subsidies  begin  exerting  a  promotion effect when   the   enterprise   scale   in   a   region   is   higher. These   findings   improve   our understanding of the role of government subsidies for the technology innovation process and have important implications for policy makers.",,"O’Connor, G.

"QI, LI","MIAO, RUI",,,,,,A MULTI-OBJECTIVE OPTIMIZATION DESIGN OF SERVICE PORTFOLIO FOR ELECTRIC VEHICLE LEASE,18 - Service Innovation and New Service Development," The electric vehicle (EV) lease industry has developed rapidly in many countries around the world with the support of government policies. However, the service mode of EV lease is poor, which cannot meet the diversified needs of users, so the development of EV lease is hindered. In terms of service design, Stenger et al (2018) prove that by modularizing and combining service products, the package combination of different functional modules can be realized, which can better meet the needs of customers. Li et al. (2018) divide the service packages on the basis of different elements and propose a method for modularly solving the combination of service plans. According to the existing research results, the service portfolio design rarely involves vehicle lease. And related research is mostly aimed at customer satisfaction, lacking comprehensive consideration of factors such as program compatibility and cost. In addition, the setting of customer’s and expert’s evaluation values in the service developing process is too subjective, resulting in subjective deviations in evaluation values and weight values. 
A service portfolio for EV lease has been developed to provide different service packages for different user groups. Firstly, the fuzzy theory and the HoQ method are used to transform the user requirements into service elements and weights, so as to construct multiple options and multiple service elements. In the same time, the user's expectation level of service elements and the evaluation of the requirements for the alternatives could be obtained. Then, the disappointment theory is introduced to describe the customer's delight and disappointment perception to characterize and calculate the user's perceived performance. Concepts and calculation functions for program cost, compatibility, and market competitiveness index are proposed. The multi-objective service portfolio optimization design model with the highest customer perceived performance, lowest cost, best program compatibility and maximum market competitiveness is finally established. The service plan decisions can be made on the basis of a multi-target weight determination method for multi-stage. Through an actual project case, with the data from an EV lease company, the availability of the model can be verified. For different stages of the market, different service packages are set up for different user groups, providing scientific and effective decision-making methods for service portfolio design of EV lease companies. Service portfolio product development has a significant effect on meeting user selection needs, optimizing user experience, and improving the competitiveness and profitability of enterprises. It is worth noting that this process and method is suitable for the service package portfolio development process of most service industries. "," Stenger, David, et al.

"LIU, REBECCA ","MANNHARDT, LUCA",,,,,,DESIGN THINKING AND BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"This empirical study explores how design thinking is applied for business model innovation in firms.
Today, business model innovation is no longer a theoretical concept but is increasingly becoming a decisive business practice in many firms (Damanpour, 1990; Gassmann, et al., 2014). And yet, failures in business model innovation are frequently reported (see e.g. Christensen, et al., 2016). To this end, prior studies (e.g. Brown, 2009; Jenkins & Fife, 2014) suggest that the application of design thinking1 may play a crucial role in developing business model innovation in firms. Yet, we know limited of firms’ practices upon this endeavour (Hassi & Laakso, 2011; Johansson-Sköldberg, et al., 2013). This is the point of departure in our paper.
To address this issue, we employ qualitative research that allows us to surface the complexity embedded in firms’ practices. A research framework (Figure 1) is constructed from the literature. In short, we investigate different business model dimensions (value proposition, value chain, customer and profit mechanism) in different phases of the business model innovation process (initiation, ideation, integration and implementation). Data are collected from six case studies in the original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) of the automotive industry. In studying business model innovation, automotive OEMs are deemed to be important and appropriate as many of them are frequently required to renew their business models in order to be able to compete in the markets. To increase the validity of this study, the informants in each case studies are carefully selected based on their experience, knowledge and engagement in design thinking and business model innovation. To ensure the soundness of our study, we use content analysis (Gläser & Laudel, 2010) and cognitive mapping (Miles, et al., 2014) to analyse a huge amount of data.
In general, our data suggest that, in the business model innovation developing process, the application of design thinking contributes more to the ideation (Brown & Wyatt, 2010; Bonakdar
1 This study is based on the definition of design thinking as “a discipline that uses the designer’s sensibility and methods to match people’s needs with what is technologically feasible and what a viable business strategy can convert into customer value and market opportunity.” (Brown, 2008, p. 86)

& Gassmann, 2016) and integration (Brown & Wyatt, 2010; Hassi & Laakso, 2011) phases than the initiation and implementation ones. Interestingly, our data indicate that some practitioners seem to ignore the predictability and linearity in the design thinking process, which can be risky or even harmful to companies in the initiation and implementation phase. Furthermore, our data suggest firms well apply design thinking to re-define their value proposition (Liedtka, 2011; Tschimmel, 2012) and to manage customer equity in an innovative way (Brown, 2008; Brenner, et al., 2016; Liedtka, 2011). We however do not find the same degree of application upon the innovation in the mechanisms for profit and value chain improvement. Finally, our data indicate the critical role of corporate culture and its influence towards the effectiveness of the design thinking application (Martin, 2007; Schmiedgen, et al., 2015) on business model innovation (Frankenberger, et al., 2013). Our paper concludes with three major propositions for further investigation together with its theoretical and managerial contributions.","Bonakdar, A. & Gassmann, O., 2016.

"LØBNER, KRISTIAN",,,,,,,BUSINESS MODEL INNOVATION IN PROJECT-ORIENTED BUSINESSES,"04 - Engineering, Production and Supply Issues in Innovation and Product Development","The capability of business model innovation (BMI) has materialized as a research field and as a competitive advantage for businesses in the 21st Century (Teece, 2010), (Zott, et al., 2011), (Casadesus-Masanell & Zhu, 2013). Yet, both academia and industries call for further understand-ings of the managerial and organizational aspects of BMI (Björkdahl & Holmén, 2013); (Winterhalter, et al., 2014); (Berends, et al., 2016).
The number of project-oriented businesses is on the rise, the share of work-time spent in projects increases and findings suggest that project-oriented work, innovation and economic performance goes hand in hand (Wald, et al., 2015). Yet, we still know little about BMI in project-oriented busi-nesses (Blindenbach-Driessen & van den Ende, 2006), (Gemünden, et al., 2018) and only a few re-cent papers contribute with insights on this matter (Aversa, et al., 2015), (Snihur & Tarzijan, 2018).
One industry with particularly many project-oriented businesses is the Construction Industry. Deliv-ering reliable and future-proof buildings and infrastructures for billions of people worldwide, the Construction Industry accounts for almost 10 % of GDP in industrialized countries (European Commission, 2016). Several studies from leading consulting firms (e.g. McKinsey, Deloitte, PwC and KPMG) characterizes the Construction Industry by low innovation, slow labor-productivity growth and lack of internal processes to support innovation. The rise of Industry 4.0 is a burning platform for the Construction Industry to innovate their business models through digital platforms (World Economic Forum, 2018). The capability of managing BMI is key for long-term growth of project-oriented businesses in the Construction Industry.
In the constant pursuit of BMI, business leaders face the challenge of managing the dynamics (Gulati & Puranam, 2009). Based on (Bucherer, et al., 2012), we propose a conceptual framework of the two dimensions of 'innovativeness' (radical vs. incremental innovation) and 'organizational
[2]
fit' (integration vs. separation), which we apply for mapping BMI projects in the Construction In-dustry. The level of innovativeness is determined by four levers and their newness to the business unit; technology, management, organizational form and co-creation (Volberda, et al., 2018), and the level of 'organizational fit' is determined by the differences or similarities of vision, values, cul-ture, incentives, and processes between the old and new business model (Markides, 2013). As the BMI projects are studied through a period of three years, we tracked the changes in innovativeness and organizational fit.
We applied an inductive and theory-building approach based on multiple-case study (Eisenhardt, 1989). First, we qualitative mapped 16 BMI projects within the proposed theoretical framework through +30 interviews with relevant employees in the period 2016-2019. Second, we identified patterns and trajectories for BMI projects throughout this framework. Third, we used thick descrip-tions of four selected BMI projects to reflect on the managerial influence on 'innovativeness' and 'organizational fit' in project-oriented businesses in the Construction Industry.
The results points to five major managerial determinants for these trajectories; a) management dedi-cation; b) the degree of co-creation; c) risk taking; d) incentive structures and e) speed of iterations. Further, the findings suggest that managerial influence to maintain innovativeness across time plays an important role for the BMI performance, while changes in organizational fit affect derivative ef-fects for further BMI projects. This study contributes to the burgeoning field of management of BMI as well as BMI in project-oriented businesses, while providing further insights for managers of BMI projects in project-oriented businesses in the Construction Industry.","Aversa, P., Haefliger, S., Alessandro, R. & Baden-Fuller, C., 2015.

"LOHRMANN, MIRIAM","BAYÓN, TOMÁS",,,,,,USER DESIGNED PRODUCTS AND NEW VENTURE SUCCESS,"05 - Innovation Management in Start-ups, Small Firms and Collaborative Enterprises","Across various industries, new ventures such as Threadless and Quirky have become established by introducing low-complexity user designed products. These new ventures have actively integrated their customers into the innovation process by outsourcing the idea generation and product development process to their user communities. In doing so, such companies are closer to their customers’ needs and wants and can signal to them that the company has already been accepted by potential customers.
Prior research has shown that companies introducing low-complexity user designed products, are able to increase the customer’s purchase intention, generate higher sales, have lower failure rates and are more successful, than those utilizing professional designers (e.g. Dahl, Fuchs, & Schreier, 2014; Fuchs, Prandelli, Schreier, & Dahl, 2013; Nishikawa, Schreier, & Ogawa, 2013; Schreier, Fuchs, & Dahl, 2012). These effects might occur, because the label “designed by user"" can act as a signal, which changes the consumer’s belief and therefore can function as a cue that sells better (Nishikawa, Schreier, Fuchs, & Ogawa, 2017; Schreier et al., 2012). However, until today research has rarely discussed the role of user designed products in a new venture context and has neglected its value to new venture success. Especially in a new venture context this signal could decide about product and company failure as product and company success are highly correlated within the first years of a company’s existence (Wang, Song, & Zhao, 2014).
In a new venture context, customers lack the experience with the company and its products. For that reason, customers might use labels, such as “designed by user"", as extrinsic cues to evaluate the product and the company. These symbols could help new ventures to gain customer cognitive legitimacy (CCL) (e.g. Fischer & Reuber, 2014; Mort, Weerawardena, & Liesch, 2012; Rao, 1994; Zott & Huy, 2007). CCL is one of the key elements to a new venture’s survival and has been shown to increase the customer’s purchase intention (e.g. Aldrich & Fiol, 1994; Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2003). However, prior literature has discussed the concept of CCL differently (e.g. Nagy, Pollack, Rutherford, & Lohrke, 2012; Shepherd & Zacharakis, 2003; Wang et al., 2014). Therefore, based on an extensive literature review we conceptualized and defined CCL as the customer’s curiosity about the company and the product, their belief in the future existence of the company and its products, and the perception of the manager’s competence. Based on this definition, we developed a CCL- scale within five studies. This scale is an essential step to further understand the effect of low-complexity user designed products in a new venture setting.
Furthermore, we suggest that the label “designed by user” may become a factor deployed by a customer in recommending a non-complex product to a friend. We test this boundary condition in an experimental setting by using a 2 (user designed vs. design by designers) x 2 (positive WOM x no WOM) between-subjects design. The results show that for products, with no WOM the label “designed by users“ increases CCL and purchase intention. However, in case of positive WOM the label “designed by users “backfires and decreases CCL. This effect might occur, because customers might not understand the fit between the different information or even feel that they got more information than necessary.","Aldrich, H. E., & Fiol, C. M.

"MAGNANINI, SILVIA ","VERGANTI, ROBERTO",,,,,,ENGAGING IN INNOVATION: DESIGN-BASED EXPERIENCES FOR MEANING MAKING,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"In the last years, from being the prerogative of dedicated departments within
organizations, innovation has diffused across all organizational functions. Indeed,
multiple extrinsic and intrinsic factors, such as open innovation, digital
transformation and the underway shift from products to software and services, have
concurred in moving innovation from professionals to all employees (De Anca &
Aragon, 2016; Fischer 2014). For this reason, engagement has become a key factor in
every company which pursues innovation (Hill, 2014). This has become fundamental
to keep individuals focused, motivated in activities to make innovation happen,
especially within organizational environments where cultural limitations and
structural rigidities (Kilian, Sarrazin, Yeon, 2015; Stickdorn, Lawrence, Hormess,
Schneider, 2018) cause resistance to the spreading of Creative Confidence (Kelley and
Kelley, 2013). As the concept of engagement is concerned in the literature,
researchers mainly focused on understanding effective managerial practices for
employee motivation (Macey, 2009; Isaksen and Akkermans, 2011), depicting
antecedents and effects on job performance (Rich, 2010).
However, when it comes to innovation, the main challenge relies no more in
engaging people in the generation of many ideas (Verganti, 2017; Burkus, 2013), but in
finding and pursuing new shared meaningful directions (Verganti, 2017). Indeed,
within the human experience of negotiating meaning (Wenger, 1991), individuals are
engaged in converging towards shared sense of purpose as a form of collective
sense-making. Past research on collective sensemaking has focused the attention on
conversational practices such as argumentation (Weick, 1995) or communications
(Cornelissen, 2011) to support convergence around shared sense.
Recently, however, several studies have highlighted the role of design as a powerful
trigger of engagement in supporting innovative processes thanks to its capability,
not only to enhance communication, but mostly to make and frame objects and
representations (Stigliani and Ravasi 2012; Cross, 2011). However, rather than being
interpreted in terms of a structured process (Brown, 2009), design can be read as a
powerful enabler of co-creation activities, engaging people in meaningful directions
(Schon, 1995; Pendleton-Jullian and Brown, 2016) through the interaction among
people and artifacts (Kolko, 2015). Drawings and prototypes (Carlile, 2002; Bechky,
2008), visual maps (Tversky, 2014; Lietka, 2010) and other visual and textual
representations are just a few of the many design artifacts that may lie at the center
of the design space (Kolko, 2015) around which individuals craft new shared
meaningful directions.
This paper aims to place emphasis on how to engage people in innovation through
the co-creation of metaphoric representations (Heracleous and Jacobs, 2008). Six
experiments within organizations from different industries have been carried out to
understand how the process of involving people in innovation projects through the
intrinsic meaning of metaphoric images (Kuipers, Tierry, Jones, 2018) can increase
their engagement level in innovation. In particular, different groups of employees
and stakeholders have been engaged through digital prototypes in co-creating
activities within innovation projects, based on different levels of interactions with
metaphoric images.
Results show that indeed the co-creation of metaphorical images increases the level
of people engagement in innovation. In particular, employees have greater
engagement in experiments where they actively participate to the co-construction of
meaning through the “texturing” of shared images. Texturing (i.e. the elaboration of
an image by changing nuances, cropping, combining images, or adding details)
enable people to participate to a visual conversation without having the need of
being expert in visual language.
From an innovation management perspective, results aim to contribute by proposing
i) a design-based model, leveraging on interactions between people and
representations, to engage people and stakeholders in shared meaningful directions;
ii) a comprehensive methodology to connect different stakeholders in the
engagement process; iii) a set of guidelines and insights to make engagement
through design tangible and actionable. In conclusion, our research may offer to
managers and organizations valuable insights on how to engage people in innovation
through new methodologies and digital tools in order to spark change and deliver
impact.","Bechky, B. A. 2008. Analyzing Artifacts: Material Methods for Understanding Identity, Status,

"MAIER, LUKAS ","EISMANN, TOBIAS E.","MEINEL, MARTIN","BACCARELLA, CHRISTIAN V.","VOIGT, KAI-INGO","FIXSON, SEBASTIAN",,CREATIVITY IN TEAMS: THE ROLE AND INTERPLAY OF TRUST AND SHARED MENTAL MODELS,01. Creativity in New Product Development,"Introduction/Theoretical background. Coming up with creative ideas is the first step for successful innovation and thus organizational success (Anderson, Potocnik & Zhou, 2014). In business context, creativity is often developed within teams (Hülsheger, Anderson & Salgado, 2009). Accordingly, several researchers emphasize that a firm’s future success depends on its ability to exploit the creative potential of its teams (Rego et al., 2007).
Team creativity refers to teams producing new and useful ideas to keep organizations competitive through innovation (Amabile, 1997). Prior research has primarily focused on personal characteristics of team members (e.g. intrinsic motivation) and organizational factors (e.g. culture) that influence team creativity. Nevertheless, it is obvious there are also team factors that affect team creativity (Gupta & Benerjee, 2016). So far, empirical studies have, for example, examined the effects of team collaboration (e.g. Hoegl & Gemuenden, 2001), team composition (Baer, Oldham, Jacobsohn & Holungshead, 2008), leadership style (Jaussi & Dionne, 2003), and team climate (Gilson & Shalley, 2004) on team creativity.
More recently, trust and shared mental models (SMM) within teams have been examined in the context of team creativity. However, empirical findings on the influence of both factors on team creativity show contradictory effects and are not fully understood yet. For example, Barczak, Lassk and Mulki (2010) found that trust enhances a collaborative culture, which in turn enhances team creativity, whereas Tsai, Chi and Fung (2012) showed that trust negatively influences creativity in teams with a positive group affection tone. Moreover, empirical studies reveal positive (Santos, Uitdewilligen & Passos, 2015) as well as negative (Skilton & Dooley, 2010) effects of SMM on team creativity. In addition, the importance of trust as a factor influencing the development of SMM has not yet been sufficiently researched (Mohammed & Dumville, 2010).
Therefore, the aim of our study is to improve the understanding of how trust and SMM influence team creativity and to give new insights into the relationship between these two factors.
Methodology. We used a sample of graduate students of a major European university for our study. 254 students were randomly assigned to 53 teams of approximately five members each (51.6% female, average 25 years).
The teams were informed about the task to “improve the learning experience” at the university. From this moment on, the teams were given two weeks to elaborate on their solutions. In the end, each team had to send in a one-minute video about their final solution. The final solution could be a new product, service, or business model.
Team creativity was rated by condition-blind coders experienced in teaching following the approach of Dean et al. (2006). Moreover, participants answered a questionnaire to test for our independent variables. We used 7-point Likert scales (1 = total disagreement; 7 = complete agreement) for our measures. The measures were aggregated by team. We measured trust with McAllister’s (1995) scale including the affective and cognitive dimensions of trust. SMM was measured with the scale from Santos et al. (2015).
Findings. Our findings show that affective trust negatively influences team creativity (B = -0,80, p = 0,05) and that cognitive trust has no significant influence on team creativity (B = -0,39, p > 0,05). Moreover, we find that SMM negatively influences team creativity (B = -0,83, p = 0,03) and that cognitive trust (B = 0,82, p = 0,00) and affective trust (B = 0,74, p = 0,00) positively influence SMM. Bootstrapping analyses (Preacher & Hayes, 2008) further reveal that SMM mediates the relationship of cognitive trust and team creativity (CI95%: -2.29; -.15), but not the relationship of affective trust and team creativity (CI95%: -1.42; .18).
Theoretical contributions. The present work enhances the understanding of team creativity by showing that affective trust and SMM of a team negatively influences team creativity. In addition, the present study demonstrates both cognitive trust and affective trust as factors that support the development of SMM in teams.
Managerial implications. Our findings suggest that managers and team leaders within organizations should be aware of the potential risks of too much trust and SMM on team creativity. Accordingly, managers should avoid too much SMM within teams by providing a certain degree of diversity within the teams or rotating single members between different team.","Amabile, T. M. (1997).

"MARTINSUO, MIIA ",,,,,,,SYSTEMIC INNOVATIONS THROUGH INTELLIGENT TECHNOLOGIES: THE TRANSFORMATION AND ITS BARRIERS IN A BUSINESS NETWORK,17 - Radical Innovation,"Organizations seeking radical innovations do not settle merely with product and service innovations, but they sometimes pursue value or business model innovations that may renew the logic of doing business significantly (Berghman et al., 2012; Chesbrough, 2010; Matthyssens et al., 2006). For example, intelligent technologies that enable the connectedness of products, equipment and entire processes with each other and related services are considered by manufacturing firms as a possible means for extending or transforming the firm’s business logic (Porter & Heppelman, 2014). Such innovations may be systemic, i.e., innovations “whose benefits can be realized only in conjunction with related, complementary innovations” (Chesbrough and Teece, 2002, p. 128).
In case of systemic innovations, members in a business network cannot drive the innovation alone but they depend on the other members whom they cannot necessarily control (Chesbrough and Teece, 2002). Forming the business network and identifying a shared value proposition take place already at the front end of the innovation and may be a challenging task (Reid & De Brentani, 2004; Takey & Carvalho, 2016). Previous research has not covered sufficiently the business logic transformation and related barriers in initiating systemic innovations, and more research has been called for in the domain of intelligent technologies (Tongur & Engwall, 2014).
The purpose is to explore intelligent technologies as a systemic innovation, particularly in terms of the transformation and barriers anticipated at the front end of the innovation. The goal is increased understanding on the implementation requirements of systemic innovations, specifically in the case of an intelligent technology to be adopted in a business network. The focus is on two research questions: 1) How (through what kind of a transformation) is the systemic innovation initiated in a business network? and 2) What kinds of barriers do customers perceive for adopting the systemic innovation?
Research method
An embedded case study was carried out in a material and system manufacturer that is developing increased intelligence into its offerings, component materials in particular. This innovation can be considered as systemic: benefiting from it would require renewal in component technologies, products, systems and services and depends strongly on the involvement and acceptance of other stakeholders in the business network. Data were collected at the front end of the innovation in the focal firm as well as in its two market segments through interviews (n=27) and four workshops. The focal firm has consequently invested in developing and testing the intelligent technology, but its market success is not, yet, known.
Findings, contributions and implications
The analysis framework covers the anticipated transformation needed in the business network; involvement of different stakeholders in the business network; and identified barriers to implementing the systemic innovation. The two embedded units of analysis (i.e. markets considering the adoption of the systemic innovation) are mapped and contrasted with each other, to identify possible context-specific patterns. The findings will contribute to the discussion of systemic innovations by proposing a framework of the required transformation at the front end of the innovation. A second contribution is made to research on intelligent technologies, particularly through pointing out the barriers experienced by different stakeholders in the business network when adopting a systemic innovation.","Berghman, L., Matthyssens, P., & Vandenbempt, K.

Innovation project portfolios, however, are very sensitive to the uncertainty of business (Martinsuo et al., 2014), and managers need flexibility, intuition and even improvisation in managing the portfolios (Jerbrant & Karrbom Gustavsson, 2013; Kester et al., 2009; 2011).
Previous research has already paid attention to the needs for changes in the innovation project portfolio. Some studies point out the importance of agility at the level of the portfolio: the need for the firm to adapt the innovation portfolio flexibly, if the business environment changes (Kester et al., 2011; 2014; Kock & Gemünden, 2016). Some other studies focus on the actions of managers – i.e., level of practice - in improvising and negotiation, when making decisions concerning the innovation portfolio or solving day-to-day issues in it (Blichfeldt & Eskerod, 2008; Christiansen & Varnes, 2008; Jerbrant & Karrbom Gustavsson, 2013). Such research draws attention to managers’ daily actions associated with the dynamics in innovation project portfolios, and more practice-centric research has also been called for (Clegg et al., 2018; Martinsuo, 2013).
The objective in this study is to identify alternative patterns of managing changes in IPPM in uncertain and dynamic conditions. The focus is on the question: how do firms manage changes in IPPM? This study is delimited to highly innovative organizations (according to their strategy and market position) operating on dynamic markets where changes are ordinary.
Research method
A qualitative multiple-case study was carried out in three medium-sized firms in different industries (construction, software, consumer products). All firms develop and deliver products and services to customers and operate in dynamic markets. The firms are oriented toward growth in their strategy, they are considered as “industry innovators” and they are among industry leaders nationally. Data were collected through interviews (n=15) with key persons involved in managing innovations in the firms, complemented with some firm-level public information and document data concerning the firms’ official IPPM approach. The analysis covers strategy connections in IPPM; changes emerging in IPPM; and practices and routines for managing changes.
Findings, contributions and implications
All the case firms had a single innovation project portfolio, but the firms differed in the overall IPPM approach and, consequently, also in the way in which changes were managed. We identified alternative patterns for managing changes in the innovation project portfolio: holistic director-centric, fragmented department-centric, and isolated project-centric. We will characterize these different patterns, map actors’ different types of involvement, and identify the related organizational routines. The findings offer insights to the practice-centric research on IPPM particularly concerning the management of changes in IPPM. For managers, the research show various tactics that may be useful in matching the innovation portfolio with the dynamics in the business environment.","Blichfeldt, B.S., Eskerod, P., 2008.

"MAZZOLA, ERICA ","PIAZZA, MARIANGELA ","PERRONE, GIOVANNI",,,,,CORPORATE VENTURE CAPITAL SYNDICATION STRATEGIES: A DYNAMIC NETWORK PERSPECTIVE,15 - Open Innovation,"Several corporates participate in CVC programs and most of them syndicate their investments with other corporates by taking minority equity stakes of the same startup. This practice, which is embraced by over 80% of corporates, is known in literature as CVC syndication (Anokhin et al., 2011). Co-investing the same startups, corporates are embedded in sets of relationships that shape a CVC syndication network (Granovetter, 1985). This kind of inter-organizational network creates a social structure in which corporates engaging in a CVC syndicate can take different positions and gain different benefits from them (Baierl et al., 2016; Koka and Prescott, 2008).
Prior network research has emphasized a dynamic dimension of inter-organizational networks to understand how these networks form and evolve over time and several reasons have emerged why scholars should care about the dynamics of inter-organizational networks (Argyres and Zenger, 2012; Gilsing et al., 2016). Such a dynamic perspective could also be relevant when studying the CVC syndication network. For example, studying the dynamics of the CVC syndication network could allow us to understand why corporates voluntarily change their positions in the network and how corporates shape the CVC syndication network to monitor startups’ technologies. However, previous CVC syndication literature adopting a network perspective is limited and it has addressed this phenomenon just adopting a static perspective (Anokhin et al., 2011; Baierl et al., 2016). Thus, despite the relevance in understanding how and why the CVC syndication network forms and evolves, there are no studies that address the CVC syndication phenomenon through a dynamic network perspective.
In this paper, we aim at filling this gap going beyond the static dimension of the CVC syndication network and exploring the evolutionary dynamics of a network of CVC coinvestors over time.
Approach and theoretical development
We investigate the evolution of the CVC syndication network using two different perspectives. First, we investigate the architectural evolution of the CVC syndication network following the framework proposed by Ahuja et al. (2012). Specifically, we examine the evolution of the five dimensions (i.e. degree distribution, connectivity, clustering, density and degree assortativity) characterizing the CVC syndication network. Second, we explore the strategy evolution of
2
corporates when syndicating their investments. In particular, we explore how the three network strategies, such as prominence, entrepreneurial and relational evolve over time.
Figure 1. Theoretical framework
Data and findings
We investigate the evolution of the CVC syndication network by considering 1272 corporates that have engaged in CVC syndication programs in a twenty-year time window from 1995 to 2014. We selected our sample of corporates and gathered data about their syndication activities from the Thomson Reuter VentureXpert database.
Results suggest that the CVC syndication network significantly evolves over time according to the five structural network dimensions suggested by Ahuja et al. (2012). Moreover, findings from the network strategy evolution investigation suggest that the three network strategies behave differently over time since they are differently affected by network memory.
Conclusion, contributions and managerial implications
This study contributes to the literature of CVC by shedding light on the evolution of CVC syndication network. Specifically, we complement the investigation of network architectural evolution proposed by Ahuja et al. (2012) by explaining how network strategies behave differently over time because of the dimension of network in terms of number of nodes and network memory. Finally, the result of this research offers also important managerial implications supporting corporates in choosing their CVC syndication strategies over time.","Ahuja, G., Soda, G. and Zaheer, A.

"MAZZOLA, ERICA ","PIAZZA, MARIANGELA ","PERRONE, GIOVANNI",,,,,THE SIGNALLING EFFECT OF DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION TO VENTURE CAPITAL INVESTORS? AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION IN THE HEALTHCARE SECTOR,15 - Open Innovation,"Innovations are typically distinguished by their ability to either strengthen or disrupt current businesses (Christensen et al., 2015). Disruptive innovation displaces old technologies creating new ones in their place, and it is often described as the only way to successfully compete in today’s globalized economy (Weiblen and Chesbrough, 2015).
Previous scholars and emblematic examples, such as Facebook and Tesla Motors, suggest that are innovative startups, which typically develop such disruptive innovations and bring them to the market (Schumpeter, 1961; Crocket et al., 2013). Indeed, since they are unencumbered by the sunken investments and not involved in the preconceived structures of traditional sectors, startups are usually better able to embrace these emerging technologies creating new business models, opening new market opportunities and disrupting established industries (Hargadon and Kenney, 2012; Weiblen and Chesbrough, 2015).
In this context, a critical role for the startups’ innovativeness is played by venture capital investments, both Independent Venture Capital (IVC) and Corporate Venture Capital (CVC). Indeed, it is largely recognized that startups receiving IVC investments from professional investors and CVC investments from established corporates outperform comparable non-IVC-backed and non-CVC-backed startups (e.g. Alvarez-Garrido and Dushnitsky, 2016; Baum and Silverman, 2004).
Previous literature has recognized several signals a startup can leverage on to increase its level of IVC and CVC financing attractiveness, e.g. patents, alliances, and team experience (Baum and Silverman, 2004; Hoenig and Henkel, 2015). However, so far, there are no studies that investigate the effect that developing disruptive innovations has in increasing the investments received by startups, both IVC and CVC investments. Thus, a relevant question may arise: “is the disruptive innovation a signal for IVC and CVC investors that are looking for innovative startups to be backed?”.
To answer to the previous question, this paper aims to understand how startups can signal their innovativeness both to professional and corporate investors by investigating the relationship between startups’ disruptive innovation and IVC and CVC investments.
2
Approach and theoretical development
Leveraging on the Signalling theory (Connelly et al., 2011) we hypothesize that developing a disruptive innovation positively affects the likelihood that a startup attracts both IVC and CVC investments. Moreover, because professional investors and corporates investing in innovative startups are different in their level of experience and objectives when investing a startup, we advance that disruptive innovation differently attracts IVC and CVC investments.
Data and findings
To empirically test the conceptual framework, we built an ad-hoc dataset based on more than 800 innovative startups operating in the healthcare industry. We specifically choose the healthcare industry since it has recently experienced a proliferation of disruptive innovations aimed at enhancing life expectancy, quality of life, diagnostic and treatment options, as well as the efficiency and cost effectiveness of the healthcare system (Omachonu and Einspruch, 2010).
To build our dataset we gathered data from economic and business journal articles, and from the Thomson Reuter VentureXpert database considering a twenty-year time window from 1995 to 1014.
We expect that startups developing disruptive innovations are more attractive in terms of both IVC and CVC investments received. Moreover, we also expect that professional investors are more able to recognize the disruptive innovation as a quality signal for investing a startup than corporate investors.
Conclusion, contributions and managerial implications
This study contributes to the literature investigating the startups’ by shedding light on the effect that disruptive innovation has in attracting IVC and CVC investments. Moreover, the result of this research offers also important managerial implications supporting corporates and independent investors in recognizing the most promising start-ups to invest in.","Alvarez‐Garrido, E., & Dushnitsky, G.

"MELNYCHUK, TETYANA ","SCHULTZ, CARSTEN","WIRSICH, ALEXANDER",,,,,EFFECTS OF UNIVERSITY-INDUSTRY COLLABORATIONS IN BASIC RESEARCH ON DIFFERENT STAGES OF PHARMACEUTICAL NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,15 - Open Innovation,"Translating basic research into successful launch of innovations into the market is a time
and resource consuming challenge for numerous companies across different industries.
Nevertheless, basic research is a fundamental ground for developing radical innovations
(Jong and Slavova, 2014). As basic research is usually associated with high levels of
uncertainty and risk of failure, engaging in collaborations with external partners in
conducting basic research may accelerate and improve an innovation process (Du et al.,
2014). Universities are considered to be valuable cooperation partners (Un et al., 2010,
Wirsich et al., 2016), particularly in the phase of discoveries and inventions. Although
the prior studies emphasize a positive impact of university-industry collaborations (UIC)
on a firm innovative performance in general (George et al., 2002, Un et al., 2010), a clear
empirical evidence of UIC effect, especially in basic research, on the development of new
products is still lacking. This is particularly interesting in industries with long
development time and high expenditures such as pharmaceutics and biotechnology
(DiMasi et al., 2016). Due to the very long development time and complex testing
procedure in clinical trials, it is essential to investigate whether basic research may
improve the firm innovation process in the different stages of clinical testing.
Based on the resource based view (Barney, 1991), our study proposes that scientific
knowledge created in joint basic research projects with academia enhances firms
performance at early and middle phases of new product development and, thus,
contributes to firm’s competitive advantage. To test these arguments, a focus of this study
is laid at pharmaceutical and biotechnological sectors that strongly build upon basic
research and academic insights (Cohen et al., 2002, Mansfield, 1998). A unique panel
dataset of scientific publications in basic research co-authored with academia and data on
clinical trials of the 65 largest international pharmaceutical and biotechnological
companies in the years 1999-2016 was collected and analysed. The results provide
insights that UIC in basic research positively affect the ability of firm to invent new
products (the number of related clinical trials of phase 1 and 2). This effect is intensified
by a firm’s strong focus at a specific research area, indicating a higher degree of
absorptive capacity. However, UIC in basic research appear to have no significant impact
on the actual successful testing of the new products in later phase of the market validation
(clinical trial phase 3). This may reveal that applied research plays a major role in this
stage (Henard and McFadyen, 2005). A contribution of this study to existing literature on
UIC lies in exploration of advantages of UIC in basic research for development of new
products in the early and middle stages of development, particularly for knowledge and
research intensive industries. Furthermore, consistent with the resource based view, it
demonstrates that exploitation of external resources such as UIC facilitates firms’
innovation output and, therefore, their competitive advantage. Additionally, this study
suggests knowledge and research based firms’ managers to engage in basic research
collaborations with universities to foster firms’ product development innovation.","Barney, J. (1991). Firm Resources and Sustained Competitive Advantage. Journal of

"O'SULLIVAN, MICHAEL ","SHEAHAN, CON",,,,,,STREAMLINING THE FUZZY FRONT-END AND IMPROVING THE USABILITY OF THE TOOLS INVOLVED,01. Creativity in New Product Development,"Researchers have spent decades developing tools and techniques to aid teams in the new product development (NPD) process. Despite this, studies have shown that there is a huge gap between their academic prevalence and their industry adoption. For the fuzzy front-end in particular, there is a wide range of tools to choose from, including the Kano Model, the House of Quality, and many others. In fact, there are so many tools that it can often be difficult for teams to know which ones to use and how they interact with one another. Also, studies have shown that, while many industrialists admit that the tools developed in academia would be beneficial to their NPD efforts, they claim that they carry a learning curve that is too steep and that they become too complex to manage over time. In essence, they believe that they are simply not worth the effort required to learn and use them. This research explores a streamlined process for the fuzzy front-end, assembling the most effective tools and making them accessible to everyone. The process was developed iteratively over the course of 3 years, following over 80 final year NPD teams from engineering, design, technology and construction as they carried a product from concept through to production specification. Questionnaires, focus groups and observations were used to understand the usability issues with the tools involved, and a human-centred design approach was adopted to produce a solution to these issues. The solution takes the form of physical toolkit, similar to a board game, which allows the team to play through an example of a new product development in order to understand the process and the tools, before using it for their own product development efforts. A complimentary website is used to enhance the physical toolkit, and it provides more examples of the tools being used, as well as deeper discussions on each of the topics, allowing teams to adapt the process to their skills, preferences and product type. Teams found the solution very useful and intuitive, and experienced significantly less confusion and mistakes with the process than teams who did not use it. Those with a design background found it especially useful for the engineering principles like Quality Function Deployment, while those with an engineering or technology background found it especially useful for design and customer requirements acquisition principles, like Voice of the Customer. Products developed using the toolkit are added to the website as more examples of how the it can be used, creating a loop which helps future teams understand how the toolkit can be adapted to their project, whether it be a small consumer product or a large B2B service. The toolkit unlocks the potential of these beneficial tools to those in industry, both for large, experienced teams and for inexperienced start-ups. It allows users to assess the market potential of their product concept faster and more effectively, arriving at the product design stage with technical requirements prioritised according to their customers’ needs and wants.","Akao, Y., King, B. and Mazur, G.H., 1990.

"OGUGUO, PRINCE","BODAS FREITAS, ISABEL MARIA","GENET, CORINE",,,,,NATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND FIRM-LEVEL BENEFITS FROM R&D COLLABORATIONS,15 - Open Innovation,"Firms increasingly adopt open innovation (OI) strategies due to rapid technological advances and the ever-present demand for innovation which require that a firm has timely access to diverse streams of knowledge and to skilled knowledge workers who can develop, use and recombine that knowledge. However, considering that firms are embedded in a national institutional context, how these institutional contexts impact the benefits a firm will derive from OI is still not fully understood (West et al., 2014).
Research question and theoretical background:
To address this gap in the literature, this paper investigates how the national institutions influence the benefits a firm derives from collaborative R&D at three phases of OI (West and Bogers, 2014): obtaining (network benefits), integrating (organizational benefits) and commercialising (product/technology benefits).
This study draws on institutional theory to explain the effect of firms’ institutional context on the benefits they derive from R&D collaboration. This literature emphasizes how norms, shared expectations and regulations orient actors towards the development of certain practices, skills and competences (Nelson and Nelson, 2002).
Thesis:
It is proposed that in a national institutional context, a specific collaboration logic develops, underpinned by the design of policy support for innovation (representing formal institutions) as well as knowledge-revealing practices amongst firms (informal institution). This collaboration logic influences the ability of firms to benefit from R&D collaboration. We theorize that these effects occur due to the influence of national collaboration logics on the nature of firm interaction and organization for innovation.
Data/Method:
This study relies on a sample of 601 firms in Europe. Results are inferred from ordered probit regression models which are estimated simultaneously using a system of Seemingly Unrelated Regressions.
Findings:
Empirical analysis suggests support for our main arguments. We find that firms see greater advances in organizational processes and product/technology development when public financial incentives for business enterprise R&D are directly administered (using grants instead of tax credits), but lesser network

benefits. The same relationship is observed in countries where knowledge-revealing practices are more widespread amongst firms.
Relevance:
Policymakers seeking to boost the collaborative development of innovative products and technologies will be better off using direct grants to support firm R&D instead of tax credits. Furthermore, these policymakers should pursue anti-trust and intellectual property legislation, that would permit firms to engage in knowledge-revealing practices while minimizing their potential exposure to loss of critical proprietary knowledge.","Nelson, R.R., Nelson, K., 2002.

The research question guiding this work explores how firms are implementing industry 4.0 (i4.0) and developing new products and services enabled by the emergent new capabilities. The specific context of the study is the agri-food sector. The theoretical relevance of the study comes from the identification of new factors in the implementation of i4.0 impacting innovation processes and outcomes, including new forms of production system management, decision-making, monitoring of products, and process configurability and sustainability (Liao et al, 2017). Those factors have practical relevance for firms that are engaged in (or planning) i4.0 implementation.
Brief literature mapping and key references
i4.0 captures practices that enable process connection and improved product traceability based on the introduction of digital technologies and big data (Buer et al, 2018). These technologies promise improved control of process and product evolution internally, and improved responsiveness to external demands. Agostini and Filippini (2018) indicate that the i4.0 is a paradigm that encompasses all the firm dimensions. The technologies associated with the i4.0 may also allow new combinations of firm capabilities influencing firm capacity for products and services innovation. Liao et al., (2017) in their research agenda for the study of i4.0 encouraged exploration of factors influencing the impact of i4.0 on firm results. Implementation is one of these factors. Some considered are lean, continuous innovation, team working and team rewards (Bengtsson et al., 2018; Buer et al, 2018; Tamas, 2016).
Theoretical development and research model
The conceptual framework links industry 4.0 as a facilitator of the firm product innovations. I4.0 is expected to have a positive effect in product innovation due, primarily, to the generation and treatment of ""big data"" and the improvement in connection and traceability (Liao et al., 2017) which will allow and speeder and accurate process for the creation and production of new products. In this exploratory work we study the direct influence and the firm dimensions that mainly affect this relationship in the agri-food sector (figure 1).
Approach/Method
The research design incorporates a comparative study of agri-food firms in two sectors – dairy and beef - in two European countries – Spain and Ireland. Four case studies are under way in firms implementing the i4.0 technologies in these settings. The agri-food industry is the largest manufacturing sector in the EU based on turnover and employment (www.fooddrinkeurope.com). It is diversified in terms of firm operations profile, scale and products. Moreover, consumers are aware of the food chain and expect information about the activity and sustainability of firms, nutrition implications, origin and the ethical production of food. So, for example, reducing time from farm-to-fork in order to maintain product quality requires timely

availability, processing, transportation and traceability of materials of the correct characteristics.
Figure 1. Conceptual framework
Findings & Results
The study is a step towards influencing the development of i4.0 the industry. The results will describe and analyse the experience of firms in four settings that are implementing i4.0. It will inform the development of follow-on research within and outside the agri-food sector in relation to implementation.
Conclusions and contributions to the field
The paper will present evidence of a relationship between implementation of i4.0, innovation and operations improvement. Reflections on this evidence will lead to actionable insights, contributing to the emerging literature on i4.0.
Managerial implications
The immediate benefit will be to the case firms engaged in the study. Capturing and codifying their practices will help both within the firms and in the broader sector.","Agostini, L., and Filippini, R. (2018). Organizing for industry 4.0: an empirical investigation.

inventions, adoptions, adaptations, appropriations and/ or transformations; Gewald et al,
2012: 3) to cope with the widespread resource challenges encountered. Dominated by
examples from India and those initiated by multinationals (e.g. Unilever’s washing
powder sachets; van Beers et al, 2012), the frugal innovation literature is sparse on the
frugal innovations initiated by local entrepreneurs in developing countries such as
Uganda. In this paper, we direct attention to the synergies that entrepreneurs enact by
integrating the multiple social and business ventures owned to create opportunities for
sustainable frugal innovation. The role of entrepreneurs in creating synergies enabling
frugal innovations is unexplored.
Drawing from the market studies approach, this study attends to frugal innovation as an
ongoing process; as an outcome of highly specific and concrete everyday practices
performed by human and non-human actors (cf. Kjellberg and Helgesson, 2006). We
examine the everyday frugal innovation practices of entrepreneurs who integrate multiple
business and social ventures in Uganda, and ask 3 questions: how do entrepreneurs
synergise multiple ventures to foster frugal innovations? What motivates these practices?
What challenges are encountered in the process, and how can these be addressed? To
address these questions, we take a qualitative multi-case study approach and draw on
material gathered in 2016-2017 in 3 contexts: waste management, sustainable energy and
HIV advocacy.
Our contribution is 3-fold. First, we address a concern that the participation of local
actors in frugal innovation practices is trivialised (Mwangi and Rutte, 2012). We do this
by foregrounding the critical role played by entrepreneurs in: translating models and
ideas from diverse contexts into frugal solutions, assembling local resources to develop
frugal solutions, and creating markets for frugal products. We build on the frugal
innovation literature, highlighting the qualities that local actors develop (and the
conditions needed) to enable their active participation in synergistically enacting frugal
innovations.
Secondly, this paper contributes to the embryonic market studies research on developing
contexts, which has heretofore focused on market innovation, agencing, framing and the
formation of markets. Frugal innovation market practices remain unexplored in this body
of work.
Finally, we empirically illuminate the distinctive frugal innovation practices unfolding in
an African context, addressing a gap in a field dominated by research on India. The paper
raises implications for practice for the enhancement of MSE and community-led frugal
3
innovations. It calls for infrastructural support to local frugal innovators, and for the
development of policies that are reflective of local contexts.","Basu, R.R., Banerjee, P.M. and Sweeny, E.G., 2013. Frugal innovation: core

"SUK PARK, JIN","SUZUKI, SATOKO",,,,,,THE IMPACT OF PERCEIVED CREATIVITY IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ON EMPLOYEES’ JOB ATTITUDES,01. Creativity in New Product Development,"In this paper, we extend the conventional point of view interpreting the perceived creativity of new products by adopting an interdisciplinary approach to establish comprehensive explanation from marketing literature as well as organization studies. It has been discussed that a perceived product creativity can influence consumers’ purchasing behaviors, and we show that such influence of product creativity is also observed in the organizational behaviors. A group of internal stakeholders who would be directly affected by the product creativity is a new product development team as it is the principal agent of the process, which is also this paper’s context.
We draw on two dimensions of product creativity – novelty and meaningfulness – from the new product development studies (Im & Workman Jr, 2004; Rubera, Ordanini, & Griffith, 2011) to define the perceived product creativity. According to argument that novelty represents the exploration whereas meaningfulness is for exploitation (March, 1991), we hypothesize that there would be two parallel paths in the relationship between perceived product creativity and new product development team’s performance. One path starts from novelty, then the exploratory attitudes of team members will be formed, and finally a new product performance is observed. Another path starts from meaningfulness, then the exploitative attitudes of team members will be formed, and finally the performance.
A survey study was conducted to investigate the association between perceived product creativity and team members’ attitudes in the context of new product development. We collected data from 274 individual respondents from 43 Japanese companies working on the new product development. The results of team-level analysis with 44 teams in a structural equation model showed the framework assuming the
separation of two paths (i.e., exploration and exploitation): product novelty led to the influencing attitude of employees and the increased attention to market potential, whereas product meaningfulness led to the conflict avoidance and focus on trust within team. We also observed several positive outcomes – increased team performance and team satisfaction – in this two-path model.
The major contribution of these findings is the implication that perceived product creativity is also working for employees’ attitudes and not just for customers. Future study should consider introducing organizational identity theory (Ashforth, Harrison, & Corley, 2008) to further explore the mechanisms bridging the product level creativity and employees’ attitudes.","Ashforth, B.

"PARKER-STRAK, RACHEL ","BARNES, LIZ","STUDD, RACHEL","DOYLE, STEPHEN",,,,DISRUPTION OF THE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PROCESS WITHIN ONLINE FAST FASHION RETAILERS.,03 - Emerging and Early Research (Young Scholars Track),"The UK fashion industry has changed in the last twenty-five years with the introduction and development of new technologies, extended supply chains coupled with outsourcing, increased consumer demands and changing consumer behaviour. These changes have disrupted many business models within the fashion supply chain for example in the areas of consumer expectations, retail formats, product assortment, speed to market and manufacturing (Barnes & Lea-Greenwood 2006; Christopher et al. 2004; Doyle et al. 2006; Goworek 2014; McCormick et al. 2014; Tyler et al. 2006) Given the scale and significance of the fashion sector, coupled with the changes previously mapped out, it is appropriate to note that there is limited research in the field of Fashion Product Development (FPD) with relatively few theoretical models that support the process (d’Avolio et al. 2015; Goworek 2010; Pechoux et al. 2004; Moretti & Braghini Junior 2017; Silva & Rupasinghe 2016). The existing models however are linear, not specific to business type and do not consider the changes and challenges in contemporary UK High Street fashion sector.
This research critically investigates product development in the context of UK fast fashion online retailers who are developing ‘own label’ fashion clothing. In so doing, the research places considerable focus upon inputs, outputs, planning and management in order to map comprehensively the interplay of people, processes and procedures of product development adopted.
Goworek (2010) proposed that to work effectively, fashion product development processes involve co-operation rather than mere co-ordination, mirroring practice in the domain of engineering design as suggested in the work of Boujut and Laureillard,
(2000). This idea has formed the basis of this research, applying theories from New Product Development (Cooper & Kleinschmidt 1995; Hart 1996; Johne & Snelson 1988; Krishnan & Ulrich 2001), Project Management (Clelands & Ireland 2002; Lock 2013; Major 2010; Packendorff 1995; Soderlund 2004) and Fashion Product Development to identify any parallels, similarities and gaps to establish the contribution. The research adopts a qualitative research approach with key informants from the fashion industry to examine product development from a project management and new product development perspective. The major findings of this research demonstrates a process model more appropriate for contemporary and challenging fashion retailing and specific to online fast fashion businesses. It also identifies the links and parallels from New Product Development (NPD) process model structures and Project Management (PM) business approaches and theories. This research explores the necessity of product development theoretical models that are specific to business and retail type within the fashion industry and contributes to the nascent theory specifically on fashion product development. This research aims to challenge the traditional Fashion Product Development Process and presents a new model more reflective of the context in which the business model is focused with a more robust management underpinning derived from the project management and new product development literature.","Barnes, L. & Lea-Greenwood, G., 2006.

"PATRICIO, RUI ","MOREIRA, ANTONIO","ZURLO, FRANCESCO",,,,,IMPROVING THE INNOVATION PROCESS THROUGH GAMIFICATION: AN EXPLORATORY CASE STUDY,01. Creativity in New Product Development,"Previous studies have shown that integrating gamification in innovation is a
promising research avenue. Moreover, a need to study and further validate the
actual value of gamification in relation to innovation, considering, in particular, its
mechanics and participants’ motivation, has been identified in the literature
(Brandt, Messeter, & Binder, 2008; Kavaliova, Virjee, Maehle, Kleppe, & Nisar,
2016). Therefore, the purpose of this paper is to examine how gamification
approaches, i.e. the use of game elements in non-gaming contexts, can improve
the innovation process, particularly the idea development phase of the early
stage of innovation. Gamification is proposed in this paper to overcome the
difficulties of managing the innovation process such as volatility, informality, goal
setting, coordination, alignment, motivation and knowledge building (Birkinshaw
& Mol, 2006; Ollila & Yström, 2016; Ulrich & Eppinger, 2012; Vaccaro, Jansen,
Van Den Bosch, & Volberda, 2012; Zimmerling, Hoflinger, Sandner, & Welpe,
2016).
Brief literature mapping and key references
The early stage of the innovation starts with ideation that includes insights
discovery, idea generation, idea selection and development, and ends with the
decision, positive or negative, to develop a new product/service (Kurkkio,
Frishammar, & Lichtenthaler, 2011; Riel, Neumann, & Tichkiewitch, 2013;
Wowak, Craighead, Ketchen, & Hult, 2016).
Gamification, i.e. the process of making activities more game-like, in non-game
contexts, to encourage users’ motivation and engagement in a particular task
(Deterding, Dixon, Khaled, & Nacke, 2011), e.g. to improve employee
engagement or outside it, e.g. to co-develop products with customers
(Piligrimiene, Dovaliene, & Virvilaite, 2015; Robson, Plangger, Kietzmann,
McCarthy, & Pitt, 2015).
Approach/Method
The paper follows a qualitative research perspective, influenced by Yin’s (2009)
contribution to the theory. Conducting a case study research in a real business
setting is appropriate as it facilitates a more comprehensive understanding of
such an emergent phenomenon (Goffin, Ahlström, Bianchi, & Richtner, 2018;
Kindström, Kowalkowski, & Sandberg, 2013; Ponelis, 2015; Yin, 2009).
Theoretical development/research model/research questions
The paper argues that gamification approaches can support and improve the idea
development phase of the innovation process, by generating multiple positive
outcomes. Two research questions were investigated in the context of a firm that
used gamification approaches to idea development: firstly, what are the main
outcomes of gamification approaches to innovation process? and secondly, how
should gamification be deployed across the innovation process to generate
positive outcomes? These research questions were the starting point in the
investigation process, which allowed articulating the whole research design and
provided rich insight into the specific context of gamification approaches to
innovation process (Creswell, 2007).
Data/Findings
The results show that the proposed gamification approach substantially improves
aspects of employee’s engagement, team spirit, and consensus building as well
as the management of idea development in a more structured and timely
manner. Findings also suggest that the main drivers of a successful gamification
deployment in the idea development phase are workshop iteration and
facilitation.
Conclusion and contribution to the field
The originality of this paper is the use of gamification approaches to support and
manage the idea development phase of the innovation process. This topic was
extended from the existing literature that discusses the relationship between
innovation and gamification, providing potential implications for both theory and
practice with evidence of gamification approaches to innovation in a real business
setting.
Managerial implications
Besides providing implications for theory in the area of the innovation process,
results are particularly important to innovation, R&D, and new product/service
development managers interested in using gamification to support and improve
the early stage of the innovation process.","Birkinshaw, J. M., & Mol, M. J. (2006). How management innovation happens. MIT Sloan

"PIEL, MARIO ","FISCHER, DENISE",,,,,,"TO RENEW, OR NOT TO RENEW? INVESTIGATING THE ROLE OF CEO REGULATORY FOCUS IN STRATEGIC RENEWAL OF FIRMS",07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"Facing intensified competition and pressure to innovate, incumbent firms seek continuous strategic renewal (Agarwal & Helfat, 2009). As a key element of corporate entrepreneurship (CE), strategic renewal involves “dramatic changes in, or replacement of, the firm’s key attributes” (Basu & Wadhwa, 2013). In this context, new product development is central to sustained renewal. Schmitt et al. (2016) theorize how managerial cognitive processes and environmental scarcity shape renewal choices. However, they do not only highlight a gap concerning empirical validation of the impact of individual-level attributes on renewal strategies but also call for research that scrutinizes how other context factors that determine firms’ competitive positions impact executives’ innovative renewal decisions.
We address this gap by introducing the psychological construct, CEO regulatory focus, to strategic renewal literature. Regulatory focus theory (Higgins, 1997) postulates that individuals self-regulate decision-making and goal pursuit through a promotion focus (associated with an eagerness strategy and preference for growth and advancement) or prevention focus (associated with a vigilance strategy and preference for stability and risk avoidance). Building on Gamache et al. (2015) who show that regulatory focus shapes strategic decision-making and acquisition behavior, we argue that regulatory focus can explain how CEOs pursue renewal. Furthermore, we suggest that firm-internal and external conditions affect this relationship.
Thus, we answer two questions: How does CEO regulatory focus affect strategic renewal? How is this relationship moderated by financial slack and environmental turbulence?
Data/Methodology
Our longitudinal study builds on a singular, manually-collected dataset comprising permanent, non-financial S&P-500 members from 2006 to 2017. We operationalize the two distinct independent variables, CEO promotion and prevention focus, by coding letters to shareholders (LTS) from annual reports and conducting computer-aided text analysis (CATA) with Gamache et al.’s (2015) regulatory focus dictionary. We measure the dependent variable, strategic renewal activities, and the moderators, financial slack and environmental turbulence, following Basu & Wadhwa (2013), Kim et al. (2008), and Saboo et al. (2016). Controls for relevant CEO-, firm-, and environmental characteristics are included. We test our hypotheses calculating multiple-regression models with Stata and aim to finish analyses by December 2018.
Results/Contribution
First interesting findings indicate that promotion (prevention) focus has a positive (negative) impact on strategic renewal of firms. Furthermore, financial slack and environmental turbulence enforce (weaken) the relationship between CEO promotion (prevention) focus and strategic renewal.
Hence, our contribution to research is threefold. Firstly, we enrich CE and innovation theory by empirically revealing how CEO regulatory focus shapes the propensity to promote or prevent renewal activities subject to internal and external factors. We directly refer to Basu & Wadhwa’s (2013) call to unearth “managerial motivations for, and antecedents to, strategic renewal by established firms.” Secondly, we advance upper echelons and leadership literature by demonstrating how individual-level, psychological characteristics of executives are mirrored in firm-level renewal strategy. Thirdly, by conducting CATA to LTS we are among the first to apply the dictionary by Gamache et al. (2015). Thereby, we deliver longitudinal results leveraging a unique dataset and validate the explanatory power of this innovative method.",,"Agarwal Renu, & Selen, W. (2009).

"POLTHIER, ANDREAS ","KUESTER, SABINE","VON JANDA, SERGEJ ",,,,,TURNING PROBLEMS INTO OPPORTUNITIES - HOW COMPANIES CAN LEVERAGE CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS FOR NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,08 - Managing Knowledge and Information Systems in New Product Development,"Companies develop products to meet customers’ needs but it is impossible to satisfy each and every customer. Customers dissatisfied with their product experience might voice their dissatisfaction to the responsible firm, i.e., they complain to the company (Morel, Poiesz, and Wilke 1997).
Research shows that adequately managing customer complaints can help to recover lost customers and improve profitability (Fornell and Wernerfelt 1988; Homburg and Fürst 2005) but the literature on companies’ handling of complaints does not capture all opportunities associated with customer complaint management (CCM). Indeed, little attention has been devoted to complaining customers in the realm of new product development (NPD) (Schuhmacher and Kuester 2012). While Yilmaz et al. (2016) suggest to consider benefits of organizational learning from complaints, exploratory research proposes that complaints can also serve as a source for NPD (Christiansen et al. 2016). Thus, the basic tenet of our research is that companies can leverage information contained in customer complaints as a valuable source for NPD. Our objective is to explore whether and under which conditions companies leverage CCM for the purpose of NPD.
In an exploratory study on CCM, conducted by interviewing relevant managers in different industries (e.g., consumer durables, FMCGs), we found that customer complaints are heterogeneous with regard to their potential benefits for NPD. Likewise, we discerned heterogeneity regarding companies’ response behavior to
complaints. Based on these findings, we set out to investigate these research questions: Under which circumstances do companies respond to customer complaints? How do firms leverage the ideas of complaining customers for NPD given that complaints differ in their potential benefits for NPD?
While prior research recommends using customer and user feedback in NPD (von Hippel 1986) or inviting dissatisfied customers to idea contests (Schuhmacher and Kuester 2012), our exploratory research reveals that firms do not fully capture complaints’ NPD potential. Based on organizational inertia theory (Zhou and Wu 2010), which states that companies often stick to standard operating procedures, we hypothesize that companies’ response behavior to customer complaints does not differ for complaints containing ideas that can potentially be leveraged for NPD compared to complaints not containing such information. To test our hypothesis, we conducted a field experiment in which we sent a generic online complaint message to companies in diverse FMCG and consumer durable product categories. These companies were randomly assigned to one of two manifestations of our manipulation innovative potential of complaint message: Either the complaint contained an explicit idea for NPD, or it did not. All messages requested a reply from the company. As dependent variables we recorded whether and how firms replied and the response time. We controlled for industry and firm size.
Preliminary results from the ongoing experiment indicate that companies do not differ in their response probability and response time to these two types of complaints. This finding holds across industries and firm sizes.
Our research contributes to the literature by providing insights into companies’ response behavior to customer complaints for the purpose of NPD (Christiansen et al. 2016). In the next phase of our field experiment, we will extend our research to additional industries to generalize our findings using a larger sample and to derive implications for firms seeking to leverage the information contained in complaints for successful NPD.","Christiansen, J.

"PRASUHN, JACQUELINE ",,,,,,,BEYOND THE LIKE: AN EMPIRICAL INVESTIGATION OF SOCIAL MEDIA ENABLED OPEN INNOVATION AND NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PERFORMANCE,15 - Open Innovation,"Main topic and objective
New digital technologies, in particular social media, paved the way for significantly increased breadth and depth of interaction with external stakeholders (Pérez-González et al., 2017). The estimated economic impact of social media on businesses exceeds $300 billion from innovation alone (Chui et al., 2012). Despite this, practice and research have mostly focused on the relevance of social media tools for the marketing domain (Quesenberry, 2016, Marion et al., 2014) while these tools, universally accessible at any time by anyone, offer compelling opportunities for open innovation (Mount and Martinez, 2014).
Therefore, the objective of this research is to build theory and empirically investigate: How does social-media-enabled open innovation (SMOI) relate to the effectiveness and efficiency of new product development (NPD)? How do competitive intensity, demand volatility and technological uncertainty moderate this relationship?
Literature mapping and contribution
Drawing on the literature of open innovation (Chesbrough, 2003) and the theories on the resource-based view (Pavlou and El Sawy, 2006) and absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990), we elevate the concept of NPD into the digital context.
This contributes to open innovation literature in two ways: By investigating the theoretical tension of NPD effectiveness and efficiency with regards to the resource-based view in a digital context, we provide a more integrated view on open innovation (Randhawa et al., 2016) and answer calls for more empirical research regarding the impact of social media tool usage for NPD outcomes (Roberts and Candi, 2014).
Secondly, social media has long served solely as a source of creative inspiration for firms (Kozinets et al., 2010), while this study offers more structured insights into performance outcomes of their usage (Luchs et al., 2016).
Methodology
Our sample consists of 350 product- and engineering managers from medium- to large-sized manufacturing firms in Germany across different industries.
We operationalize NPD performance using Brettel et al.'s (2011) construct. The formative construct SMOI (Du et al., 2016) includes dimensions for the front- and back-end of the NPD process. Furthermore, we measure environmental factors as moderating variables (Cui and Wu, 2017, Jaworski and Kohli, 1993, Carbonell et al., 2009). Control variables are selected specific to the research context (de Brentani and Kleinschmidt, 2004, Wilden and Gudergan, 2015). We use SmartPLS3 for our analysis, as recommended for complex models with a formative dependent variable (Ringle et al., 2015), and examine our model for various biases.
Findings and managerial implications
First results indicate that SMOI positively associates to NPD effectiveness, but negatively to NPD efficiency. Furthermore, demand volatility positively moderates this relationship, while competitive intensity does the opposite. Hence, one needs to be particularly attentive to the context of applying social media for NPD. This advances the pre-dominant literature by building theory at the cross-road of digitalization and open innovation, answering several research calls regarding technology-enabled augmentation of innovation (Nambisan, 2017).
Additionally, this study provides managers with insights about the right circumstances to use social media to advance NPD performance. Furthermore, it enhances managers ability to allocate budget for social media initiatives, understanding the impact on NPD outcomes. Concluding, this study theorizes and measures the significance of SMOI for opportunity creation (Alvarez et al., 2013) beyond the marketing domain in the new digital age.","Alvarez, S. A., J. B.

"QIU, YUNRAN","CANKURTARAN, PINAR ","JAN HULTINK, ERIK",,,,,USE OF BIG DATA IN CO-CREATION: A CASE STUDY FROM CHINA,15 - Open Innovation,"Crowdsourcing and co-creation are common innovation practices, both seen as important innovation management strategies that contribute to innovation success as teams of diverse people often find better solutions than lone thinkers, and outperform group of like-minded experts (Page, 2008). That said, in order to reap the benefits of diverse input, firms need to develop tools to understand what the real current and future needs of their users are, how their products will be used, and what solutions users develop to solve their needs (Bogers et al. 2010).
Companies can incorporate customer input into their innovation efforts by utilizing information technologies through internet (e.g, Kiang & Chi, 2001). The internet is a promising medium for companies to engage in crowdsourcing and co-creation, as evidenced by the likes of Dell, Amazon, Audi, and Muji. For example, Amazon Mechanical Turk is an Internet-based crowdsourcing marketplace that enables individuals and businesses to coordinate the use of human intelligence to perform tasks that computers are currently unable to do (Paolacci et al. 2010). New online platforms, such as mobile apps including Taobao and Alipay in China, are emerging technologies that are gaining prominence as a way of connecting customers for effective co-creation.
The use of information technologies in crowdsourcing and co-creation has also been of interest to innovation scholars. For example, numerous studies have investigated the antecedents and consequences of IT usage in NPD (e.g., Barczak et al. 2007; 2008), and has built models of customers’ roles on NPD in virtual environments (Nambisan 2002). Others have investigated brand community members’ willingness to engage in NPD, and delineated the antecedents and consequences of successful consumer co-creation (Füller et al. 2008; 2009). However, little attention has been paid to the role of Big Data. This is concerning, as Big Data has vast application potential and can be used through the whole lifecycle of product in various sectors (Li et al. 2015). Very few empirical studies have been conducted on the use of big data for successful NPD, which is probably because the use of big data by organizations is still at its early stages (Wamba et al. 2015). To the best of our knowledge, the use of big data for successful NPD has been investigated in China through only one case study which focuses on the use of big data analysis in the wearable medical equipment technology sector (Tan & Zhan, 2017). Clearly, there is a need for further in-depth analyses of applying big data techniques for NPD.
In this study we investigate the relationships between big data, crowdsourcing, and co-creation through a multiple case study involving two large firms in China. Based on the results from the multiple case study, we will develop a conceptual model for the use of big data in NPD. In the later stages of the PhD research of which this study is the first part, we will empirically test the conceptual model through a survey among a large sample of Chinese firms.","Barczak, G., Sultan, F., & Hultink, E.

"REHN, ALF",,,,,,,"CROWDS, COMMODIFICATION, AND CRITIQUE IN REPRESENTATIONS OF INNOVATION: INTERPLAY AND COUNTERFORCES",20 - Theory Development in Innovation Research,"Over the last two decades, general management studies has seen a considerable growth in
what is known as critical perspectives (see Prasad et. al 2015) as well as a broader
understanding of the diversity of agents affected by management practices. In innovation
studies, this development has been slower and less pronounced. However, as of late some
engagements of this nature have emerged, both on the academic side (see e.g. Godin & Vinck
2017) and in the broader, public debate (see e.g. Baird 2017). These engagements have
however run along the broad pro-vs-con alignment well-known from critical management
studies. I will in the following argue that this kind of oppositional logic is less suited for the
field of innovation studies, and suggest an alternative take, emphasizing the hybrid nature of
the field.
Central in this argument will be the notion of audiences. Although audience theories (cf.
Ruddock 2001, Willis 2017) are rarely deployed in innovation research, this paper will argue
that in order to understand the interest in innovation studies, we need to develop a theory of
“innovation audiences”. This, as the paper will also argue that much of what is written on
innovation, particularly for a larger audience, can be understood as a commodity (cf.
Heusinkveld 2013). That is, representations of innovation and innovativeness are often
constructed so as to be easily consumed, prompting a further commodification. In this
process, “innovation” as a category becomes increasingly a marker for representations of new
value creation that suit the audience, rather than an analytical category – which can be
ascertained by e.g. analyzing the biases through which examples are given precedence over
others.
What I will argue, then, is that innovation studies, in order to establish its main subject of
study as a meaningful concept needs to re-assess the establishment of said concept. By
analyzing it as created in the dynamic intersection of commodification and critique, I argue
for the development of both sounder innovation engagements and a sounder innovation
critique. I will show how a close reading of popular representations of innovation can be
utilized to highlight effects of both commodification and critique, and also outline a more
developed theory of innovation audiences.","Baird, R. (2017), The Innovation Blind Spot: Why We Back the Wrong Ideas—and What to

"REINHARDT, RONNY","SCHWABE, MARIA","WALSH, GIANFRANCO",,,,,SUSTAINABILITY-PROFITABILITY INFERENCE – DEVELOPMENT OF A SCALE AND INVESTIGATION OF CONSEQUENCES FOR NPD INVESTMENT DECISIONS,10 - Managing Sustainability in Innovation and Product Development,"Managers making new product development investment decisions face a potential dilemma in that they are expected to achieve the dual goals of profitability and sustainability. Prior research has shown that decision makers’ values and general beliefs exert an influence on investment decisions (Hafenbrädl & Waeger, 2017; Hemingway & Maclagan, 2004). By extension, one can expect a manager’s belief about the general relationship between sustainability and profitability to affect new product investment decisions. However, there are no existing scales to measure this phenomenon. Consequently, the present research develops a measurement instrument for sustainability-profitability inference and tests its effects for NPD investment decisions.
Brief literature mapping and key references
Managers often need to make inferences that go beyond the directly available information to make investment decisions (Dane & Pratt, 2007; Eling, Griffin, & Langerak, 2014). When deciding whether to invest in sustainable new products, a managers’ personal inferences regarding sustainability and profitability can impact investment decisions in addition to objective product information. We define sustainability-profitability inference (SPI) as a decision maker’s conviction about how sustainability and profitability are related for investment decisions. SPI thus reflects the strength and direction of the assumed relationship between sustainability and profitability. Following compensatory reasoning research (Chernev & Hamilton, 2008), SPI manifests in one of three “extreme” convictions: (1) trade-offs, (2) independents or (3) complements.
Method
In Study 1, we generated an initial item set from related scales and 30 interviews. Study 2 relied on 14 expert judges to evaluate the content validity of the initial item set. In Study 3, the remaining 24 items were tested with 323 participants working in leadership positions to refine the scale, resulting in a 12-item measurement instrument. Study 4 used an experimental design and manipulated the environmental sustainability of new product ideas, measured SPI, and tested the impact of SPI on the profitability assessment of sustainable and non-sustainable new product ideas with 265 participants, 58 % of which were employed or self-employed. In Study 5, we manipulated SPI and tested the consequences for an investment decision, which the 202 participants believed would influence their bonus payment.
2
Findings
Exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses suggest that the SPI scale provides a reliable and valid measure of SPI. In addition, the results from Study 4 show that the more decision makers generally belief sustainability and profitability to be complements, the more profitable specific sustainable innovations are perceived to be. Study 5 demonstrates that decision makers rely on their SPI to make investment decisions – even when real monetary incentives are involved.
Conclusion and contribution to the field
Decision makers rely on their general belief about the relationship between sustainability and profitability to assess new product ideas. This can have detrimental effects for both new products and sustainability because these beliefs may be unrelated to the specific product.
Managerial implications
Firms need to be cognizant of the fact that their decision makers have inherent beliefs that may be inconsistent with firm goals. Thus, firms need to ensure that NPD selection panels consist of decision makers with SPI values that reflect the firm’s goals.","Chernev, A., & Hamilton, R. 2008.

"RESCH, CHRISTIAN ","KOCK, ALEXANDER",,,,,,DIFFUSION OF KNOWLEDGE WITHIN ONLINE MAKER COMMUNITIES,15 - Open Innovation,"The ‘Maker Movement’ is a trend with a large potential for sourcing future innovations.
Makers are individuals with skills in rapid prototyping technologies (e.g., 3D printing and
microcontroller boards), who are able to quickly turn their ideas into prototypes or products
(Dougherty, 2012; Anderson, 2013). While the innovation literature has extensively
investigated the relevance and attractiveness of user innovation (Hienerth, Lettl, and Keinz,
2014; De Jong et al., 2015; Hippel, 2017), few studies have explicitly focused on makers
(Lindtner, 2015; Halbinger, 2018; Svensson and Hartmann, 2018). Makers differ from user
innovators in having a skillset before they have an idea with which they can not only innovate
for themselves, but also produce. Furthermore, makers’ innovation rate in makerspaces is eight
to 35 times higher than the consumer innovation rate (Halbinger, 2018).
Although makerspaces are places for collaboration and knowledge exchange, a large part of
interaction between makers takes place in online communities, which points out the need to
better understand the interaction patterns. The extensive research on online communities (Poetz
and Schreier, 2012; Bayus, 2013; Hienerth et al., 2014; Jensen, Hienerth, and Lettl, 2014; Luo
and Toubia, 2015; Gatzweiler, Blazevic, and Piller, 2017) has so far neglected maker
communities.
In active online communities, social and knowledge networks emerge. Lead-user research
has shown that central positions in social networks are particularly favourable for innovations
(Kratzer et al., 2016). Perry-Smith and Mannucci (2017), on the other hand, argue that different
network positions are beneficial for different idea phases. Furthermore, the generally expected
relationship between the social network position and the knowledge network position does not
always apply (Wang et al., 2014). These conflicting perspectives lead to our research question:
how do makers collaborate online and how does their network position affect knowledge
integration and recombination during idea development?
We collected a large dataset from a leading online maker community to address this question.
The data consist of 297,245 makers, 18,368 innovation projects, 49,140 project updates,
216,884 Likes and 92,007 comments. All data is timestamped which allows us to calculate
network centrality measurements (e.g., betweenness centrality) (Freeman, 1978; Brandes,
2001; Kratzer et al., 2016) and the content distance of the projects (Piezunka and Dahlander,
2015) at various points in time (e.g., before and after a project was posted). With this analysis
we can investigate the effects of the network position on knowledge recombination which
indicates novelty (Criscuolo et al., 2017). For further validation, we matched the dataset with
another dataset from a large open source software hosting platform where the software parts of
the projects are hosted.
The results show that a maker’s central network position, before a project is posted,
significantly influences the integration of new knowledge while makers without a central
network position tend to integrate less new knowledge.
This study contributes to the innovation literature by providing a better understanding of the
ideation processes within maker communities. In addition, the findings are relevant for network
research due to network positions’ different effects at different points in time. The findings are
also valuable for firms, as managers can better leverage maker communities to identify future
ideas and innovative individuals.","Anderson, C. (2013). Makers: Nieuw Amsterdam.","Dane, E., & Pratt, M. G. 2007. Exploring intuition and its role in managerial decision making.

Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Collaborating with customers in product design is not a new concept. For centuries, skilled craftsmen collaborate with individual customers. The advancement in technology that triggered the industrial revolution had enabled producers to design products to satisfy customers en masse but had also resulted in producers’ disregards for services. In the last three decades, there has been a revival of manufacturers’ interest to add services to their products, a phenomenon referred to as “servitisation” (Vandermerwe & Rada, 1988).
Since then, researchers have been advocating service-centric design, focusing on customer value co-creation through resources integration as defined in service-dominant logic (SDL) (Tan, Matzen, McAloone, & Evans, 2009; Vargo & Lusch, 2008). The term product-service system (PSS) is closely related to the concept of value co-creation and has often been investigated with SDL and servitisation (e.g. Kowalkowski, 2011; Neely, 2009; Ng, Parry, Smith, & Maull, 2010; Ng, Parry, Smith, Maull, & Briscoe, 2012). The constituent products and services of a PSS work together to fulfil users’ needs (Goedkoop, van Halen, te Riele, & Rommens, 1999), generating values for the network of beneficiaries and producers related to the PSS.
Although the PSS research has begun in the 2000s, the extant design methods are often too narrowly scoped to support the customer value co-creation process in the PSS lifecycle. One difficult aspect is that customers’ needs are always evolving, and companies have to continuously adapt their resources and offerings (Kindström, Kowalkowski, & Sandberg, 2013). Moreover, PSS design frameworks are usually at a business strategy level, lacking guidance to execute them at an operational level (Pezzotta, Pirola, Rondini, Pinto, & Ouertani, 2016). Furthermore, traditional new product and/or service development methods seldom illustrate how to incorporate the networks of actors - producers, beneficiaries and resources - of a new PSS to generate higher value-in-use (Wind & Mahajan, 1987; Yip, Phaal, & Probert, 2014).
How do companies become aware of, and subsequently capture the changing societal requirements and co-create value with all contingent actors in the design of new PSS? How do companies operationalise the business awareness and derive clear design specifications that promote value-in use? Concurring with many researchers who have acknowledged the connection between SDL and actor-network theory (ANT) (Storbacka, Brodie, Böhmann, Maglio, & Nenonen, 2016; Vargo & Lusch, 2016), this research is based on SDL and ANT. The research has proposed a novel integrated PSS design framework that adopts a lifecycle approach. The framework considers the interactions between the networks of actors in the value co-creation process at a business level and is integrated with techniques to deploy the framework at an operational level. The framework and its application in a healthcare case study are presented in this paper.
This paper contributes to the literature of PSS and design research, and the application of ANT in supporting the premises of SDL. The application of the integrated framework also contributes as a practical guideline to managers of PSS lifecycle and new PSS development in terms of how they may apply the proposed framework in their context.","Goedkoop, M.

"ROETH, TOBIAS ","SPIETH, PATRICK",,,,,,THE INTERACTION OF POLITICAL AND RATIONAL DECISION-MAKING PROCESSES: A BEHAVIORAL PERSPECTIVE ON AGILITY IN INNOVATION PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT,16 - Organising New Product Development,"The innovation portfolio management (IPM) is essential for an organization’s longterm
survival, since it depends on a continuous stream of successfully developed and
introduced new products and services (Killen et al. 2008). IPM describes a dynamic
decision‐making process (DMP) that evaluates, selects, prioritizes, and allocates
resources to different innovation projects (Cooper et al. 2001). Although researchers
and practitioners are aware of the importance of establishing an effective DMP that
selects and manages the most promising innovation projects, implementing such a
processes is highly challenging. Decision‐making in IPM is embedded in an instable,
uncertain environment as well as internal complexity caused by multiple goals,
different strategic aspects, and interdependencies.
Therefore, it is not surprising that qualitative research indicates that decision‐making
in IPM is frequently characterized by non‐rational behavior (Christiansen and Varnes
2009; Kester et al. 2011; Radaelli et al. 2017). In order to suppress non‐rational
behavior ‘s dysfunctional impact on DMP, the majority of IPM research investigates
how firms can design their formal processes by focusing decision‐making criteria,
strategic aspects, or the degree of centralization (Cooper et al. 1999; Kang and
Montoya 2014; Carbonell and Rodriguez Escudero 2016). Although this perspective
offers rich insights to prevent poor decisions, little is known about the actually
decision‐making behavior in firms and its effect on subsequent IPM performance
(Antons, Kleer, & Salge, 2016; Kock & Gemünden, 2016).
To address this research opportunity, we aim to investigate how rational and political
DMP interact and how they determine agility as well as IPM performance. Procedural
rationality describes the extent to which a decision process is characterized by the
gathering of information relevant to the decision and make the respective decision
by analyzing this information. Contrary, a political DMP is characterized by the pursuit
of self‐interest at the expense of organizational interests (Dean and Sharfman 1996).
We argue that both DMP determine agility, which is defined as the firm’s ability to
readily change its innovation portfolio with respect to potential opportunities and
threats (Kester et al. 2011). Further, we hypothesized that agility mediates the impact
of both DMP on IPM performance.
To test our model, we conducted a survey encompassing double‐informant sample of
131 organizations and analyzed it using PLS SEM. Results indicate that project
interdependencies positively influences procedural rationality (β= .191 (1.98)) and
politics (β= .472 (6.029)). Whereas a rational DMP directly influence IPM performance
(β= .302 (3.438)), the relationship between a political DMP and IPM performance (β=
.265 (2.81)) is mediated by agility. Surprisingly, we find an inverted u‐shaped
relationship between a political DMP and agility (β= ‐0.182 (2.998)) indicating that
there is a tipping point of political behavior and its potential positive impact on agility
in IPM.
Our insights contribute and extent knowledge in IPM by applying a behavioral
perspective on DMP (Kester et al. 2011; Kock and Gemünden 2016). In particular,
showing that political behavior and rationality interact extends first qualitative
insights (e.g. Kester et al. 2011) and complements research on agility (Kock and
Gemünden 2016). Further, we develop managerial implications.","Carbonell, P., and A. I. Rodriguez Escudero. 2016. The Effects of Decentralization in Strategy-

Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"When designers are developing new artefacts or an artefact genre, they commonly first focus on the technical development aspect, and only afterwards think of possible uses and applications for the technology. Our paper present a new methodology based on the idea that designing technology is in the first place designing how people live. This approach is called life-based design (Saariluoma, Cañas and Leikas 2016). Only after analysis of how a particular group of people live one needs to select a technology and generate technology requirements and business models.
A core process in LBD is the analysis of how people live in some definable area of life. This stage is called the analysis of form of life. Here, we concentrate on people who are retiring and thus changing their form of life. We analyse the FoL of the young elderly and their early retirement days to sketch design ideas for technology-supported FoL for this period. The aim of this research is to understand the transition from working life to retired life. The data gathered will describe the practical habit and lifestyle changes before and just after retirement, which will pave way for designing technology for this growing user group.
The interview revolved around three basic themes. The first theme was the respondent’s financial situation, with specific insights related to their pension, savings and finances to manage retirement. The second theme was to delve deeper into understanding the transition from working life to retired life, with a focus on the early retirement stage. Lastly, the interview gathered information about practical habit and lifestyle changes before and just after retirement. A total of 51 people (56% male) participated in the survey.
Interviews suggested that the forms of life we need to pay attention in developing technologies and respective business models for retiring people are travelling, winter migration, summer house,
fitness, grocery and food habits, car, and financial support to children. (Javaslgi 1992, These are the main themes of their life and thus our knowledge can be used to generate new technologies and services for the group of people.
The main goal of this paper was to study and show how the ultimate principle of LBD – the analyses of life – can be carried out in practice. This paves the way for understanding what kinds of technologies are needed and what kinds of technology requirements should be set to designers (Datye, 2012). Life-based design investigated how people live to improve the quality of life in target population. The understanding of life is used to generate technologies and business models relevant to realize the goals Kolbacher and Herstad 2008). Integrating life-based design with technology and business modelling is a rational goal.","Datye, S. (2012). Life-Based Design for Technical Solutions in Social and Voluntary Work.

Although creativity psychology scholars have made serious attempts to study the individual cognitive processes for the generation of insights in lab environments, the process by which customer insights emerge by groups in organizations is under-researched. This study, building on a micro-ethnographic research of real time data and in situ, develops a tentative future oriented sensemaking process model which shows that the customer insight capability is socially constructed and embedded in highly dynamic sensemaking processes and, it is enacted by sensefacilitating. This is a newly identified triggering mechanism by which groups synthesize plausible, socially constructed new meanings with future orientation.

"SANASI, SILVIA ","GHEZZI, ANTONIO","CAVALLO, ANGELO",,,,,BUSINESS MODEL CHANGE IN DIGITAL STARTUPS AND THE ADOPTION OF EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES,"05 - Innovation Management in Start-ups, Small Firms and Collaborative Enterprises","This study explores the way digital startups deal with Business Model (BM) change, exploring their adoption
of experimental approaches to cope with the increasing uncertainty related to the fast-changing and
unpredictable competitive scenario. This research aims at providing a guideline for nascent ventures willing
to design and validate shifts in their BM, as well as practical implications for established companies seeking
strategic renewal. Building on previous contributions, we expand and reinforce the theoretical discourse on
the use of experimental approaches in strategic management and entrepreneurship.
The concept of BM has been object of several studies published in the last decade, establishing a new
dimension for investigation in strategic management (e.g., Teece, 2010; Foss and Saebi, 2017). Scholars have
not only focused on the intrinsic structures and relationships within the BM (e.g., Zott and Amit, 2010), but
also the evolution of and across its elements (e.g., Saebi et al., 2017). However, little is known about the
process carried out by companies while moving onto these changes in their BM (Ghezzi, 2018).
Such gap calls for an understanding of whether companies dealing with uncertainty are resorting to specific
approaches to validate the changes they implement. Consequently, this research focuses on investigating the
way startups, typically more flexible and adaptive than established corporations although operating with very
limited resources (Katila and Shane, 2005; Hanlon and Saunders, 2007), approach and carry on changes in
their BM. Do they leverage on experimental approaches to deal with change and validation of , and how?
The research objective has been tackled by means of a series of four exploratory case studies, investigating the
elements and aspects of the approaches described in both practitioner and academic literature that startups
adopt and employ in the process of changing their BM. The cases were sampled by focusing on the specific
constituting element of each startup’s BM where the change process originated (as described by Saebi et al.,
2017). Preliminary findings suggest that startups adopt an experimental approach that fully or partially
resembles the framework of the Lean Startup Approaches (LSAs) (Blank, 2005; Ries, 2011; Eisenmann et al.,
2013; Ghezzi and Cavallo, 2018) to tackle the implementation of a change in their BM and to validate the
hypotheses made on the design of the new element(s). Startups seemingly adopt such an approach differently,
according to their maturity and the kind of BM change they are about to implement. Our findings suggest that,
initially, startups apply experimental approaches in an unstructured and unconscious way. Their maturation,
though, brings them to evolve, at first, towards the rigorous application of such approaches and, consequently,
to progressively tailor them to their needs.
Our work reinforces the existing contributions linking BM change with the employment of LSAs, contributing
to the academic body of work regarding experimentation in entrepreneurship and strategic management, as
well as fostering the discourse on the process of BM change, adaptation, validation, reconfiguration and
innovation.
On a practical note, this study can provide valuable hints for managers who are coping with uncertainty and
willing to undergo a process of change and reconfiguration of their company’s BM in a “startup way”.","Blank, S.G. 2005. The four steps to the epiphany: successful strategies for product that win: Lulu Enterprises

"SANASI, SILVIA ","GHEZZI, ANTONIO","CAVALLO, ANGELO",,,,,EXPERIMENTAL APPROACHES TO ENTREPRENEURSHIP AND THE SCIENTIFIC METHOD: A CRITICAL REVIEW AND COMPARISON,"05 - Innovation Management in Start-ups, Small Firms and Collaborative Enterprises","According the empiricists, science is based on experience and observation, the only means humans have to
access real knowledge (e.g., Hume, 1739). Hence, scientific rigor is not just useful to legitimate concepts;
but it is crucial in setting a method to reach the “truth”.
Companies often find themselves operating in uncertain, fast-moving and unpredictable environments, where
experimental and discovery-driven approaches may result beneficial (McGrath, 2010) for both established
companies (e.g., Power, 2014) and startups (e.g., Ghezzi, 2018). Experimentation and hypotheses
falsification can play a key role in validating and legitimizing business model choices and shifts (Bojovic et
al., 2018) by aiding executives and entrepreneurs in selecting the most suitable strategic alternatives to
pursue (Levinthal, 2017) and reducing uncertainty related to decision-making.
Taylor (1911) provided the first insight into the introduction of the scientific method in management,
suggesting that substituting the widely used “rule-of-thumb methods” with scientific ones, namely a
rigorous, structured and objective managerial process that is based on empirical data, would lead to better
results. The learning school of strategy (Mintzberg et al, 1998; Bortolini et al., 2018) and the adaptive
approach (Miles et al, 1978) have extended and built on the argument supporting the adoption of an approach
based on learning, testing and the use of empirical data to reduce uncertainty in decision-making. An
increasing number of scholars have since been igniting the discourse on the role of scientific methods in
entrepreneurship and strategy-making (e.g., McGrath, 2010; Sarasvathy and Venkatraman, 2011; Levinthal,
2017; Weissbrod and Bocken, 2017; Bojovic et al., 2018; Ganguly and Euchner, 2018; Ghezzi and Cavallo,
2018), although often lacking comprehensiveness in analyzing and including approaches and methods that
are actually employed in entrepreneurial and corporate practices.
This study aims at addressing the similarities and differences between different experimental approaches
undertaken by startups and established companies in dealing with uncertainty, often connected to renewal
processes or the launch of new products and services. By means of a critical discussion, we provide
conceptual considerations about the different experimental approaches and their relationship with the
scientific method.
Preliminary results exhibit that methodologies such as the Lean Startup Approach (Ries, 2011; Eisenmann et
al., 2013), Scrum (Schwaber, 1997), Design Thinking (Brown, 2009; Martin, 2009) and Sprint (Knapp et al.,
2016) hold the strongest similarity with the scientific method, in particular with the hypotetico-deductive
approach adopted by modern scientists when combining both inductive and deductive scientific approaches,
requiring falsifiability of the hypotheses formulated and accepting their confirmation only as provisional
(Popper, 1963).
This work holds implications for both theory and practice. Scholars in entrepreneurship and strategy can
benefit from the conceptualization of different practical approaches into theoretical ones, rooted in the
history of scientific discovery, that sets the ground for future empirical work. At the same time, practitioners
can draw useful guidelines to implement a more reliable and scientific attitude towards their decision-making
processes, when innovating and validating strategic change while dealing with uncertain environmental
conditions.","Blank, S. G. 2005. The four steps to the epiphany: successful strategies for product that win: Lulu

"SCHNELLBAECHER, BENEDIKT","MEIER, HENNING","HEIDENREICH, SVEN","BETZOLD, RICHARD","JORDANOW, SLAWKA",,,LET ME TELL YOU WHO WE ARE - THE EFFECTS OF SOCIAL ENTREPRENEURIAL NARRATIVES,03 - Emerging and Early Research (Young Scholars Track),"Entrepreneurship is essential for economies to sustain viable and keep growing (Eckhardt & Shane, 2003; Mueller, 2007). Since decades, manifold studies have investigated the linkage between entrepreneurship and innovation and confirmed the importance of entrepreneurial activities for economies to become and stay innovative (Hébert & Link, 2006; Shane & Venkataraman, 2000; Wong, Ho, & Autio, 2005).
A new promising research avenue within the field of entrepreneurship is the emergence of entrepreneurial activities within a social context, i.e. social entrepreneurship. More and more studies dedicate themselves to the topic (e.g., Harding, 2004; Murphy & Coombes, 2009; Peredo & McLean, 2006; Ruebottom, 2013; Tan, Williams, & Tan, 2005). Several studies have confirmed, that social entrepreneurship supports the economy not only in an economic way like an entrepreneur (Drayton, 2002) but also in a social way (Peredo & McLean, 2006; Sharir & Lerner, 2006; Zahra, Gedajlovic, Neubaum, & Shulman, 2009) e.g. by supporting people in need (Waddock & Post, 1991). An increasing number of studies try to shed light on the mechanisms surrounding social startups and in particular on which instruments support their effectiveness (Murphy & Coombes, 2009). In this context, calls for examining narratives as such instruments become more and more prominent (Choi & Majumdar, 2014; Downing, 2005; Hjorth & Steyaert, 2004; Martens, Jennings, & Jennings, 2007). While broad research on narratives in the social entrepreneurship domain is still missing, some empirical studies in the context of general entrepreneurship exist, that try to shed light on the effectiveness of narratives. For example, Steyaert (2007) shows that narratives can help comprehend the cultural, social and political construction of entrepreneurship by also putting its limits and possibilities into focus. In line with this reasoning, recent research suggests that narratives may affect the perceived legitimacy of social startups (Nicholls, 2010). However, until now studies scrutinizing how specific social entrepreneurship narratives may shape the environment and how significant their impact turns out on recipients, such as investors, customers or employees, are still missing (Dacin, Dacin, & Tracey, 2011).
The paper at hand addresses this issue in three major ways. The study aims to determine whether and how social entrepreneurial narratives have an impact on (1) customers’ decision to buy new products, (2) potential employees’ decision to join the social entrepreneurship as well as (3) the accompany decision of potential co-founders. To address these issues, the present study empirically assesses how 8 different types of social narratives affect perceptions of these three core stakeholder groups. The narratives were

derived from the literature, focusing either on the positive aspects of the social endeavor (charitable status, grassroots underpinnings, scientific progress, a sound business foundation or entrepreneurial behavior) or put forward the concept of an enemy, which the social startup strives to oppose. Such antagonistic narratives include the fight against economics without value basis, narrow-minded ideology or mind-numbing bureaucracy (Ruebottom, 2103). Based on the results of three experimental studies (Between-Subject-Design; nbuyer=242; nemployee=235, nco-founder=243), first empirical evidence is provided on how social entrepreneurial narratives influence different stakeholders and which impact they possess (see Table 1). Since the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test confirmed the absence of a normal distribution for each sample a non-parametric method, i.e. the Kruskal-Wallis test, was used to scrutinize the impact of each narrative on the specific target groups: consumers, employees and co-founders. First off, the effects of the eight narrative styles were tested on potential consumers. The data supports the notion, that the willingness to purchase from the startup is bolstered by putting the dedication to scientific progress (MiddleRangC = 19,57; Middle RangS = 33,39; U = 3.201; P < 0.01) or the entrepreneurial deeds (Middle RangE = 37,44; U = 2.454; P < 0.05) of the founder in the spotlight. Secondly, the analysis demonstrates that in case of potential employees, their interest to work for the startup is increased by narratives focusing on the charitable status (MiddleRangC = 22,20; Middle RangCh = 35,85; U = 3.083; P < 0.01), the sound business fundamentals (Middle RangCh = 32,64; U = 2.826; P < 0.01) or on the dedication to scientific progress (U = 2.113; P < 0.05). Finally, assessing the reaction of potential co-founders, the findings only support a positive effect of a narrative emphasizing the entrepreneurial deeds of the founder (MiddleRangC = 23,24; Middle RangE = 32,74; U = 2.177; P < 0.05) on the willingness to engage as a co-founder in the startup. For other narratives, no significant effects could be supported for the specific target groups.
Concerning implications for practitioners, the study highlights that to unlock the full potential of a social startup, founders need to pay attention to which narrative is used for potential co-founders, employees or consumers to increase the chance to acquire co-investors, dedicated employees and sales. This is especially significant as founders typically are not aware, that they could optimize their pitches using adequate narratives and match them to the corresponding stakeholder group (Ruebottom, 2103). In the case of consumers, founders should emphasize, that their start-up strives for scientific progress or entrepreneurial deeds. To acquire future employees, entrepreneurs should focus on shedding light on the startup’s charitable goals, business fundamentals or again strive for scientific progress. Moreover, the findings indicate that only a narrative centering around the entrepreneurial behavior of the founder may increase the probability to convince other co-founders to join the endeavor.","Austin, J., Stevenson, H., & Wei-Skillern, J.

"SCHRÖDER, ANNIKA","HÖLZLE, KATHARINA",,,,,,USERS & INNOVATION – A STUDY OF SITUATIONAL AND COGNITIVE-EMOTIONAL FACTORS AS MODERATORS OF USER INNOVATION BEHAVIOR,20 - Theory Development in Innovation Research,"The benefits and desirability of innovations for companies, the economy, society, and
societal welfare is undisputed and widely acknowledged. So are users as source of innovation
(von Hippel 1988). Still, situational and cognitive-emotional processes as trigger for individual
user innovation behavior are missing from this academic discourse. In this research an
argument for the situational and cognitive-emotional moderation of the inclination towards
innovation and innovation success is developed adapting the stress-coping-theory by Lazarus
(Lazarus 1966). The explanatory power of the underlying research model is tested in two
empirical studies with athletes of Paralympic sport disciplines (study 1) and patients living
with chronic disease (study 2).
Previous research on user innovation shares in common the fact that they investigate users
that operate under voluntary conditions (enthusiasts, hobbyists, semi-professionals) (among
others Kratzer & Lettl 2009, Franke et al 2006). These users share that they freely chose to
pursue the domain they now feel the desire to innovate in. Yet, with the emergence of
patients as object of research (Oliveira et al 2015, Habicht et al 2012) the assumptions on
motives and stimuli to innovate might not hold up to explain the inclination to innovate. This
specific user group is not defined by a shared passion, but through the experience of a
random, negative and life altering major life event. This research focuses on health-related
events that are classified through the scale by Holmes and Rahe (1967). It is assumed that
positive and negative emotions, innovative behaviors (generating, testing, and implementing
ideas) and behavior that is detrimental to innovation (intrapsychic coping and flight) depend
upon combined situational perceptions of users, with the perceived susceptibility to change
(situational control) the own situation (expected benefits, utility, performance) being of
particular importance.
2. APPROACH AND RESEARCH MODEL
The Lazarus theory (Lazarus 1966, 1991, 1993) which has been previously adapted to the
context of innovation (Krause 2004, Gebert 2002) is used as basis as well as the research on
Lead User theory (von Hippel 1986). Lead User are characterized by the dimension of trend
leadership and high expected benefit from the innovative solution (Hienerth & Lettl 2017).
The basic adaptation of the model is displayed in figure 1.
Figure 1: Cognitive-emotional and innovation related processes of lead user innovators
(adapted from Krause 2004).
3. (PRELIMINARY) FINDINGS
The collection of data is currently running, results are expected early 2019.
4. CONCLUSION AND CONTRIBUTION TO THE FIELD
The work contributes to further the theoretical understanding of adapting theories to the
innovation domain to increase explanation power of moderation effects on innovation
development and how to foster innovation from external and non-manufacturer sources.
Furthermore, it advances the understanding of (1) user-manufacturer interaction as users
might turn to manufacturers for help in implementing and disseminating their innovations
(von Hippel 2005). This might come with different interaction modalities for healthcare
compared to lifestyle brands (among other sources: Kanstrup et al. 2015) and (2) the nature
and measurement oft he lead user construct (Hienerth and Lettl 2017). With high expected
benefit as core aspect of the lead user concept it is conceiveable that in the context of HRSLE
increasing quality of life (QoL) is a representation of that benefit. So far, only Oliveira et al
(2015) define disease burden as independent variable but measured overall QoL as a single
item scale. Thus, enriching measures for benefit drawing on QoL-literature are presented in
this research. Therefore, these studies further various avenues for future research.","Franke, N., von Hippel, E., Schreier, M. 2006. Finding commercially attractive user

"SCHWEITZER, FIONA ","GILLIER, THOMAS","GAUBINGER, KURT",,,,,AN IDEA’S VALUE IS IN THE EYE OF THE BEHOLDER: THE ROLES OF COGNITIVE STYLES AND LEEWAY IN CRITERIA USE IN NPD IDEA EVALUATION PROCESSES,16 - Organising New Product Development,"This paper addresses cognitive styles’ roles in new product development (NPD)
decisions. We study the different emphasis idea evaluators with a rational and an intuitive
cognitive style place on market criteria when deciding which idea to push through further
NPD process stages or which to terminate.
We link the attention-based view (Gavetti et al., 2012; Ocasio, 1997) and the literature on
cognitive styles (Epstein et al., 1996; Hayes and Allinson, 1994; Kozhevnikov, 2007) to
theorize that idea evaluators with a rational cognitive style are more likely to focus on the
relevance of an idea for their existing markets and customers, while idea evaluators with
an intuitive cognitive style tend to emphasize an idea’s potential relevance for new
market creation.
We further hypothesize that leeway of evaluation criteria moderates the cognitive style’s
relevance in idea evaluation processes. Criteria for idea evaluation have low leeway when
set as objective and irrevocable institutions that are used in the same way for ideas
entering the NPD idea evaluation gate, and high leeway if they are more open to
negotiation, reflection, and interpretation (Hammedi et al., 2011). We investigate
leeway’s influence on the extent to which decision-makers fall back on their cognitive
styles. We expect that low leeway intensifies the extent to which idea evaluators with a
rational style will select ideas that cater to current markets as ideas worth developing
further, while high leeway will increase the extent to which idea evaluators with an
intuitive style will select new market creating ideas as ideas worth developing further
We find backing for our assumptions in a quantitative setting of 138 idea evaluators in
high-tech manufacturing companies. We conclude that idea evaluation committees should
be selected based on individuals’ cognitive style.
Our study contributes to the attention-based view by scrutinizing idea evaluators’
cognitive styles’ impacts on the attention they pay to idea evaluation criteria. The
presented research highlights the distinct roles the intuitive and the rational style play in
idea evaluation in the NPD process. It also contributes to research that questions the overemphasis
of rationality in managerial decision-making (Hunt et al., 1989; Sadler-Smith,
2004), since it points to intuition’s relevance in idea evaluation processes of radical
innovations.
From a substantial perspective, this finding means that companies wishing to push radical
innovations should allow idea evaluators with an intuitive style into their idea evaluation
panels, while companies that focus on non-radical innovations should involve idea
evaluators with a cognitive style. Further, idea evaluators with an intuitive style should
have more leeway in criteria use, while those with a cognitive style should have less.",,"Im, S. & Workman Jr, J. P. 2004.

"SEGELITZ-KARSTEN, ARIANE ","REINHARDT, RONNY","WALSH, GIANFRANCO",,,,,NOT QUITE THE SAME - INVESTIGATING DIFFERENT MOTIVATIONS OF LOW-END AND HIGH-END INNOVATORS,07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"Objectives and theoretical and practical relevance
A major challenge for new product development (NPD) is the positioning strategy: for which end of the price scale should the firm develop new products? Previous research indicates that these types of decisions are not merely driven by rational profit considerations (Reinhardt et al., 2017). Consequently, the present study investigates the motivations of innovators for pursing high-end innovations and low-end innovations (i.e., new products positioned above or below average market price) in an attempt to uncover the drivers of new product positioning biases.
Brief literature mapping and key references
We define low-end innovators as individuals who actively seek to engage in low-end innovation projects whilst trying to avoid high-end projects, and high-end innovators as individuals who actively seek to engage in high-end innovation projects whilst trying to avoid low-end projects. Similar research has already examined motivations of other types of innovators, such as serial innovators (Griffin et al., 2012), inventors, champions, implementers and innovators (Sim et al., 2007), and radical innovators (O’Connor & McDermott, 2004), but has not studied low-end vs. high-end innovators.
Method
We conducted two qualitative studies. In Study 1, we interviewed eleven active innovators from different industries about past innovation projects and positioning strategy decision-making. In Study 2, we advertised two innovation workshops on the university campus: one for participants interested in high-end innovation and one for participants interested in low-end innovation. We interviewed eleven of these future innovators who had not yet been influenced by a specific working environment to explore their motivations for choosing a particular workshop. All interviews were recorded, transcribed and content-analyzed.
Findings
We identified six overarching motivations including different sub-categories that influence high-end and low-end innovators: 1) Innovation Attractiveness (Profit Potential, Market Attractiveness, Competition, Brand Image, Social Good Potential), 2) Intuition, 3) Previous Experience, 4) Self-Identity (Egocentric Working Preferences, Egocentric Customer Preferences, Personal Background), 5) Firm Identity (Brand Fit, Social Expectations), and 6) Firm Capabilities (Resources).
2
The results reveal two types of differences between low-end and high-end innovators. First, the innovators had a different understanding of each motivation. For example, both low-end innovators and high-end innovators contend that their innovation mode produces higher profits; low-end products because of higher volumes and high-end products because of higher willingness to pay. Second, some motivations are only relevant for one type of innovator. For example, Egocentric Working Preferences (i.e., the “fun factor”) only play a role for high-end innovators, while they are irrelevant for low-end innovators.
Conclusion and contribution to the field
Low-end and high-end innovators have different inherent motivations and different perceptions of motivations. Several motivations, such as self-identity, go beyond rational arguments and may thus explain irrational preferences for one innovation type over the other (Reinhardt et al., 2017). The results also provide a foundation to better understand new product selection and positioning decisions. Finally, the findings provide a new angle for investigating NPD failure – a mismatch between inherent innovator motivations and the positioning strategy defined by the firm management.
Managerial implications
Firms need to match personnel to NPD projects according to their inherent motivations. For example, if high-end innovators are assigned to low-end projects, their high-end mindset could jeopardize these projects and it could cause dissatisfaction for the high-end innovators because they are working on something that conflicts with their interests or self-identity.","Griffin, A., Price, R.

"SIEBELINK, REMCO ","HOFMAN, ERWIN","I.M. HALMAN, JOHANNES","NEE, INGO",,,,SWOT VERSUS SCENARIO: AN EXPERIMENT ON STRATEGIC OPTION IDENTIFICATION,07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"he identification of high-novelty and high-quality strategic options lies at the heart of strategy and innovation (Girotra, Terwiesch, & Ulrich, 2010). Nevertheless, insufficient attention has been given to the process of option identification, especially with regards to effectively identifying options in uncertain and dynamic external environments in which one has to discover hidden options and deal with bounded rationality and information imperfection (Trigeorgis & Reuer, 2017). Prior research has pointed at scenario analysis as a tool that can be used for such purposes (Schoemaker, 1995; Schwartz, 1996). A core premise of scenario analysis is that scenarios – defined as likely (but fundamentally different) stories about how the future may unfold – help to challenge peoples’ mental boundaries and prior assumptions (Schoemaker, 1993). This may facilitate the development of options with higher novelty and higher expected value compared to conventional aids to planning, which assume that the future will be more-or-less like the present (Grant, 2003; Mintzberg, 1994). However, there is a lack of knowledge on how to effectively identify strategic options, and in particular on what the effects are of scenario analysis for option identification: research on scenario analysis and its impact on strategic option identification relies heavily on anecdotal evidence and limited empirical studies. As such, several core premises of scenario analysis have not been tested (Phadnis, Caplice, Sheffi, & Singh, 2015).
To present convincing evidence to fill these gaps, we conducted an experiment. Experiments excel in identifying causality and are able to identify mechanisms where other data sources are unable to provide insight (Charness, Gneezy, & Kuhn, 2012; Chatterji, Findley, Jensen, Meier, & Nielson, 2016; Croson, Anand, & Agarwal, 2007). We used a between-subject design with 65 students of a management course – generalizable to a wider population of professionals (Fréchette, 2015) – providing different treatments to two randomly-generated groups. For the treatments, we chose two widely-used (Glaister & Falshaw, 1999; Wilson, 1994) but completely different environmental analysis tools: SWOT-analysis, characterized by retrospective analysis, data and extrapolation of trends, and scenario analysis, characterized by synthesis of plausible futures, imagination and exploration of possible developments. In randomly-formed teams, the subjects performed either the SWOT-analysis or scenario analysis, after being trained in their respective tool. Afterwards, all subjects individually identified strategic options with a horizon up to 15 years. All resulting 279 strategic options are individually evaluated on various criteria by three strategy managers of our case firm, a technology leader in the oil and gas industry.
Figure 1: Experimental design.
Figure 2: Data structure: a multi-level between-subject design.
Based on multiple data analysis methods – controlling for a multi-level data structure (Snijders & Bosker, 2012) – we present a paradoxical conclusion: the conventional SWOT-analysis leads on average to higher value and higher novelty strategic options, yet we recommend technology leaders to also use scenario analysis for identifying strategic options. That is, scenario-based options have a larger variance, implying that they outnumber SWOT-based options in the tails of the distribution with high-value and high-novelty options. Such options are the ones that a technology leader wants to put on its roadmap in order to stay ahead of competition and continuously renew its business.","Charness, G., Gneezy, U., & Kuhn, M. A.

"SIMONSE, LIANNE ","SIMONS, DASHA","SKALSKA, ZUSANNA",,,,,STRATEGIC FRAMING OF TREND FORESIGHT,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"For innovation strategies and programs, trend foresight on user value is becoming increasingly important. In order to formulate strategic directions of design innovation, trends are considered the starting point of user values of the future. However, the strategic framing of trends and its relation to the innovation programs of the organisation are currently under-researched. Essentially a model of conceptual framing is lacking. Therefore the aim of this paper is to contribute with a conceptual framework on trend foresight. To build this, we bring together two streams of literature and shows how it relates to innovation strategy as well as to dealing with changes in the environment over time, captured in roadmapping.
First, we identify that broader horizons, with respect to innovation objectives and knowledge sources, are associated with successful innovation but that the natural tendency of strategic managers is to scan narrowly, within the existing market. Therefore, organisations often involve external experts and teams of creative professionals, to perform the trend foresight.
Second, we set out to interview trend experts and collected data from ten cases of trend foresight practice. We rigorously analyzed the case data within and across cases.
Third, we build a conceptual framework from the themes we uncovered, and generate propositions on the framing of trend foresight in strategic innovation management.
We end with avenues for future research on effective trend foresight in strategy and what organizations can do to capture value from trends.
 1. Literature review
Departing from a broad conceptual analysis on the use of the trend foresight positioned at the interplay of strategic management and design innovation, we narrowed down the review towards the lack of understanding on the strategic framing of trend foresight. How trend foresight is related to innovation strategy, including its relation to design roadmapping and dealing with changes in the environment over time.
 2. Method
We employed a qualitative inductive research (Eisenhardt, 1989). We selected ten cases by purposeful sampling and collected interview recordings, observations and social media data at independent design studios, large and small, from the UK and the Netherlands. We coded all data, first line-by-line, then by focused coding to group the coded data into categories. We ended with theoretical coding – in which we clustered the categories into themes – to build the conceptual framework.
 3.Data/findings
The preliminary findings reveal that in the pre-study, besides the organization’s market and branding, also the organization’s mindset is characterized to be able to relate to it with the scenario’s and storytelling of trend foresight, but also to shift it. Common in creating the foresight story is the synthesis of a trend model, sometimes curated through a social media platform.
We conclude with propositions associated to the conceptual framework that we build from the theoretical coding.
For both manager and designers, this paper highlights how to related trends to an innovation strategy. Successful innovations can be initiated by trends that provide foresight on user value wishes.","Crilly, N., Moultrie, J., & Clarkson, P. J. (2004).

AN ASSESSMENT OF UNIVERSITY SPINOFF FUNDING SUCCESS BY SUPERVISED MACHINE LEARNING TECHNIQUES,"09 - Managing Innovation in IT, AI and Software","Despite an increasing number of university spin-off (USO) creation, the new technology ventures show limited growth and high failure rates (Fini et al. 2017; Rasmussen and Wright 2015). For USOs to overcome the liabilities of newness in terms of initial resource and commercialisation constraints, attracting regional and national funding support can be crucial (Islam et al. 2018).
Up to now, however, the assessment of the early stage USO development projects has been associated with high complexity and largely human-based, thereby, subjective assessment. To improve the evaluation process of USO proposals, we employ text mining and machine learning (ML) techniques increasing the prediction capability of funding success.
DATA & METHODS
We analyse 400 USO funding proposals submitted to and assessed by a Valorisation Grant (VG) programme (aimed at commercialisation of tech-science results) of a Dutch Science Foundation. With regard to the USO project proposals’ content, we focus on scientific, technological as well as commercial potential. By applying automatic document classification (using supervised ML algorithms, training/test data = 0.8), we classify the proposals into two classes, based on the decision to award funding (‘0’ – not funded; ‘1’ – funded).
To conduct our analysis, we use the ‘RTextTools’ – a supervised learning package for text classification (Jurka et al., 2012) and ‘tm’ package for data pre-processing (Feinerer et al., 2008) in R. Furthermore, we employ seven algorithms embedded in RTextTools: support vector machine (Meyer et al., 2012); scaled linear discriminant analysis (slda); random forest (Liaw and Wiener, 2002); maximum entropy (Jurka, 2012); boosting (Tuszynski, 2012); bagging (Peters and Hothorn, 2012); and classification or regression tree (Ripley., 2012). Finally, we use 4-fold cross-validation of algorithm performance.
PRELIMINARY FINDINGS
The results show the algorithms` prediction capability and thereby the extent to which
proposals have been funded in an automated manner. The precision, recall and f-scores of the
implemented algorithms indicate that Bagging, Tree and RandomForest algorithms generate the
best results (Table 1). While precision metric, in case of funded proposals, indicates the ratio of
how many proposals classified as funded were actually funded. In turn, recall indicates how many
proposals from all the funded proposals were correctly predicted, thus with the current settings
we could correctly predict up to 62% of proposals. F-scores produce a weighted average of both
precision and recall (Sokolova et al., 2006).

Bagging 0.630 0.620 0.625
Tree 0.605 0.610 0.605
Table 1. Overall algorithm precision, recall and f-scores
To improve labelling accuracy, we check whether multiple algorithms yield the same
prediction, regarding the assigned funding decision class. Ensemble agreement in RTextTools
calculates coverage and recall accuracy for n ensemble agreement. Coverage scores represent the
percentage of documents that meet the recall accuracy threshold (Table 2).
Coverage Recall
n >= 2 1 0.61
n >= 3 1 0.61
n >= 4 1 0.61
n >= 5 0.74 0.66
n >= 6 0.51 0.68
n >= 7 0.24 0.74

IMPLICATIONS
By employing advanced computational methods, our findings provide a new way to deeply examine important phenomena in entrepreneurship and innovation management research. Furthermore, our study contributes to the discussion on benefits and drawbacks of current new venture evaluation criteria.
For practice, our results contribute to USO evaluation accuracy and support the process of USO screening to detect and prevent early-stage failures. In the full paper, we plan to compare our classification results with adjusted feature selection on USO survival data, thus providing funding agencies and policy makers with insights for a more objective allocation of limited budget for research commercialisation.",,"Alstott, J., Triulzi, G., Yan, B., Luo, J., 2017b.

"SUMMAD, EMAD","AL-KINDI, MAHMOOD",,,,,,ORCHESTRATING THE OMANI NATIONAL INNOVATION ECOSYSTEM: AN AGENT-BASED MODELLING APPROACH,15 - Open Innovation,"The vision of the Omani National Innovation Strategy (NIS) pays a particular attention to establishing an innovation-driven economy that would place Oman in the middle of the top 20 leading countries for innovation in the world by 2040 [1]. This would need the harmonization of all innovation related policies with one another.
To address the process of harmonizing related policies, a number of scholars have introduced the concept of complex adaptive innovation ecosystem [2], which would change its behavior in response to its environment [3]. A number of researchers drew special attention to the property of self-organizing, which refers to the capacity of ecosystem individual parts to combine and recombine their learning capabilities without a centralized control. However, other scholars stress the role of the ecosystem orchestrator for the success of the ecosystem [4]. In fact, the orchestrator normally a leading firm would perform the function of an opinion leader in the diffusion of innovations process [5].
While, the importance of collaboration between individual parts of an ecosystem as a critical requirement for producing innovation cannot be emphasized further, there will always be the dilemma of how these different individual parts would deal with the issue of balancing competition against the assumed collaboration.
The authors notice that previous research mainly study formal networks even though non-formal networks could be as significant for producing innovation. Furthermore, the authors also believe it is very important to study innovation ecosystems at the individual actor level, which would enrich our understanding of the process of knowledge diffusion amongst the different actors of the ecosystem.
This research, uses NetLogo; a consolidated multi-agent modeling environment in the innovation ecosystem domain to investigate, in a bottom-up (micro) approach, the dynamics characterizing the harmonization of Omani policies and the role that innovation policy intervention can have on governing the national innovation ecosystem. This would further enhance our understanding to the role of network structure and network effects on diffusion of innovations. Ultimately, this should help achieve an effective value-creation national innovation system in the Sultanate of Oman to drive entrepreneurship, technology, and economic impact.","The National Innovation Strategy: Community Partnership Preparation and Implementation; Scientific Insights: The Research Council Periodical Newsletter, July 2017.","Ancona, D.

"SWAN, K. SCOTT ","NOBLE, CHARLES ","HESS, RON",,,,,CAN DYNAMIC DESIGN CAPABILITIES DRIVE DISCONTINUOUS INNOVATION AND EXTEND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES?,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"Anderson and Tushman offer the following model characteristics of innovation: “An
evolutionary model of technological change is proposed in which a technological
breakthrough, or discontinuity, initiates an era of intense technical variation and
selection, culminating in a single dominant design. Discontinuities never become
dominant designs, and dominant designs lag behind the industry's technical frontier.”
(Anderson and Tushman p.604). Firms may offer discontinuous innovations early and
later incremental innovations that drive dominant designs allowing the product life cycle
to be extended – but these disparate outcomes are not easily accomplished. A critical
question is how the discontinuity affects existing capabilities during eras of foment…and
can the same capabilities still be effective in eras of incremental change?
We explore dynamic design capabilities to see if they allow firms to manage both critical
eras in the life cycle of technological change. Further, we offer insights into which
dynamic design capabilities should be emphasized given environmental conditions, i.e.,
competitive intensity, to produce desired outcomes: longer life cycles or discontinuous
innovation.
Ø Brief literature mapping and key references
Dynamic capabilities allow the firm to adapt to its changing environment critical to
achieving superior performance (Teece, Pisano, Shuen, 1997). There is recognition of an
interaction among an organization’s resources, its capabilities, and environmental factors
that help facilitate innovation, creativity, and superior performance (Shalley, Zhou, and
Oldham, 2004; Woodman, Sawyer, and Griffin, 1993). Specifically, we ask the question,
“Can dynamic design capabilities drive discontinuous innovation and also be harnessed
to extend the length of product life cycle when dominant designs emerge?”
Ø Approach/Method
A research model is a validated and preliminary analysis and fit statistics were obtained
with structural equations..
Ø Data/Findings
Preliminary analysis offers good fit statistics (see Table 1) and testing of hypotheses
supports 12 of 17 hypotheses (see Table 2).
~ 2 ~
Ø Conclusion and contribution to the field
The study examines five design-related capabilities influence on discontinuous
innovation and length of product life cycle. We find support that dynamic design
capabilities promise robust responses to increases in competitive intensity and an ability
to disrupt an industry with discontinuous innovation as well as extend the product life
cycle. Further, dynamic design capabilities help counteract the negative influences of
competitive intensity on product life cycle length. Finally, we find support that structural
elements change their role depending on whether the firm is attempting to achieve
discontinuous innovation or increase the length of PLC. Theoretically, we identify
specific capabilities that allow the firm to bridge dramatically different environmental
challenges. Analytically, our study is one of a very few studies that offer empirical
analysis of dynamic capabilities.
Ø Managerial implications
For managers, this study offers insights into robust or dynamic design capabilities that
contribute to discontinuous innovation and can still produce positive effects as the
industry matures. The structural variables also suggest non intuitive ways that firms can
dynamically emphasize capabilities and structurally organize for success.","Anderson, P., M.L. Tushman. 1990. Technological Discontinuities and Dominant

"TAHARA, SHINSUKE ",,,,,,,THE SUSTAINING OF SOCIAL INNOVATION THROUGH INTER-ORGANIZATIONAL LEARNING NETWORKS,10 - Managing Sustainability in Innovation and Product Development,"The purpose of this paper is to consider how social innovation sustain through participation in inter-organizational networks by comparing social franchising and license agreement between organizations. The definition of social innovation is a novel idea, product, and model that fulfils social needs and simultaneously creates new social relationships or collaborations (Murray, Caulier-Grice, & Mulgan, 2010). Social innovation research has been discussed based on the theory of innovation. However, there are theoretical problems that it does not develop into a widely shared concept and there is little discussion that enhances the impact of research such as comparative research and quantitative analysis (Lawrence, Dover, & Gallangher, 2014). In this paper, case study and quantitative research are conducted focusing on aspects of social innovation process. There are two research questions. The first addresses how social innovation sustain. The second addresses what factors influence the sustaining of social innovation.
2. THEORETICAL BACKGROUND
Innovation research is classified into research focusing on process and results based on three criteria of innovativeness, effectiveness, and continuity (Phills, Deiglmeier, & Miller, 2008). The former is process research on the creation and diffusion of innovation, the latter is pursuing the value of new products and services. This paper focuses on the former and researches the sustaining phase which was rarely discusses so far. Murray et al.(2010) pointed out the six-phase model of social innovation process. One of the newly added perspective is the ‘sustaining’ of the fourth phase. In this phase, Murray et al.(2010) indicated that relational capital is necessity. They described it as both knowledge and trust built up between organizations such as social enterprise and its suppliers. In this way, the management of social innovation process requires inter-organizational networks (Lawrence et al., 2014). However, collaboration by multiple organizations are a disadvantage of management difficulties such as fusion of organizational culture. Learning and trust overcome this problem. Especially, I believe that trust in inter-organizational networks aiming to solve social issues will be important in the future.
3. METHODS
I followed a case study research design to gain a deep understanding of the mechanisms of sustaining social innovation and quantitative analysis. Quantitative analysis is a survival analysis including Kaplan-Meier estimation, log rank test, and cox regression. By conducting survival analysis, I can verify factors that affect the sustaining of social innovation. The cases are learning therapy created by Kumon and Swan bakery that creates a place to hire people with disabilities. Learning therapy is innovative service programs that developed through industry-university-government cooperation in 2001. It is an innovative, non-pharmacological treatment that has been shown to improve the symptoms of memory loss among elderly adults with dementia. The data were collected from three different sources. These are interviews, observations, and archival data.
4. FINDINGS
As a result of the quantitative analysis using 441 elderly nursing care facilities that adopted learning therapy, it cleared that participating in the inter-organizational learning network among these facilities sustain learning therapy. This result can be explained in detail through case studies on Kumon and Swan bakery. This bakery is operated in the basis of the franchising system. It has diffused in Japan, but in recent years spread has stopped, there are places to close the store. On the other hand, learning therapy is operated under licensing agreement. Some nursing facilities discontinue it, but nursing facilities participating in the learning network between them tend to sustain. The learning network of learning therapy is active. However, Swan bakery does not have it. Through learning network, organizations that adopt social innovation realize knowledge transfer and sharing. Competence trust is foundation of this activity. If competence trust is enhanced by the interaction between
organizations through the network, learning will become active and the effect of social innovation will be improved. As a result, social innovation will be sustained.
5. CONCLUSIONS AND IMPLICATIONS
From the viewpoint of inter-organizational relationships, the key factor for sustaining social innovation is participation in learning networks built by organizations that adopts it and tacking knowledge sharing and knowledge transfer. Effective knowledge sharing promotes the formation of competence trust and this type of trust activates inter-organizational learning. When the effects of social innovation realize through learning, the organization will continue to the usage of social innovation. License agreements may form networks between organizations that adopt social innovation rather than franchising, and inter-organizational learning may be more likely to be active. This paper studied the mechanisms in sustaining social innovation that has hardly been discussed so far. Therefore, I believe it is a significant contribution to the theoretical development of social innovation process. A challenge for the future is to further explore the mechanisms in multiple cases.","Lawrence, T. B., Dover, G., & Gallangher, B. (2014). Managing social innovation. In M. Dodgson, D. M. Gann, & N.

"THEOHARAKIS, VASILIS","MYLONOPOULOS, NIKOLAOS",,,,,,PASSION FOR THE SMARTPHONE: THE CASE OF MOBILE SHOPPING,"11 - Marketing, Markets and Users of Innovations","Consumers in previous decades were seen to have shopping malls as their
habitat where they would enjoy a wide range of activities from the
consumption of products and services to passing time and actual enjoyment
of browsing around the mall (Bloch et al 1994). However, devices that enable
online access, and in particular the smartphone, have become an integral part
of an individual’s identity and of the extended self (Belk, 2013). The mobile
phone presents a substitute for many of the activities traditionally offered by
malls such as browsing around, entertainment, socialising and most certainly
shopping. From the perspective of the smartphone as a new virtual consumer
habitat, we explore how passion for the smartphone leads to wider variety of
installed apps, increased frequency of use, and ultimately increased mobile
shopping.
As the smartphone grows in significance in consumer’s lives, and as
consumers’ love for their smartphone grows, the device has become
intimately integrated with their user’s identity. It is therefore a surprise how
under-researched the passion of consumers for this activity has been. The
dualistic theory of passion (Vallerand, 2010), accounts for the autonomous
(harmonious) or uncontrollable (obsessive) engagement with an activity that
users love and becomes integrated to the self. Both types of passion may
coexist to different degrees, in the same person, for the same activity,
depending if the individual freely exercises their volition in engaging with the
activity, or if the activity controls the person.
Our data were collected using the Pollfish survey platform which delivers
online surveys globally through mobile apps and the mobile web
(www.pollfish.com) and has been demonstrated to be quite representative
especially if one considers that we are targeting smartphone users (Goel,
Obeng, & Rothschild, 2015). Our questionnaire was given to a panel of experts
who provided feedback and then was pilot tested. Responses were collected
from 455 US based smartphone users along with their actual installed mobile
apps.
Overall, passions provide the necessary resources and energy to intensely
engage with an activity the individual loves (Verner-Filion, et al, 2017).
Significance, regularity, engagement and commitment of time and energy are
defining characteristics of passion (Curran et al, 2015). Therefore, we
hypothesize that a person’s passions will lead to a wider number of app
categories installed, more frequent use of the phone and increased mobile
shopping intensity.
Using structural equation modelling, we demonstrate that an individual’s selfreported
harmonious and obsessive passions are antecedents of mobile
shopping intensity and of the objective measures of (1) a wider range of
installed mobile apps and (2) frequency of use. We have also included a
number of control variables demonstrating age and gender biases.
By utilising the theory of passions, we demonstrate that the love for the
smartphone is making users increasingly engaged with this new “virtual
habitat”. The implications for businesses are clear as they need to recognise
the harmonious and obsessive ways in which the smartphone and its apps
become a significant part of consumer buying behavior.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"ADIARSO TJATURPRIONO, HENDRO","GOFFIN, KEITH ",,,,,,UNRAVELING THE ROUTINES IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT,16 - Organising New Product Development,"Portfolio management is crucial to a company’s success because of the direct impact the
mix of projects chosen has on its strategy. Despite its immense significance for
management practice, portfolio management is still not well understood (The Economist,
2007). Much of what has been written focuses mainly on individual project selection
rather than the management of the entire process (Kester et al., 2011). This study
therefore aims to uncover the underlying processes which lead to portfolio decisions. It
uses an organizational routines theoretical perspective to understand organizations’
portfolio management capabilities.
Portfolio management is a “dynamic decision process” (Cooper et al., 1999, p. 335)
which can be considered to be a strategic decision-making process (Harrison, 1981;
Mintzberg et al., 1976; Thomas, 1984). Allison (1971) identified that strategic decisionmaking
includes cognitive, political and organizational elements and this has been
adopted in a number of important studies (e.g. Mazzolini (1981); Fahey (1981); Schwenk
(1988, 1989); Dean and Sharfman (1993); and Rajagopalan et al. (1993)). Organizational
routines are “regular and predictable behavioral patterns of firms” (Nelson and Winter,
1982, p. 14) which can be used to understand company performance (Salvato and Rerup,
2011). Key innovation literature, such as Kester et al. (2011) showed portfolio decisionmaking
to be complex and to involve: (1) antecedent factors, (2) decision process
characteristics and (3) outcomes (Rajagopalan et al., 1993). However, organizational
routines have been overlooked. This led to the research question: What organizational
routines can be identified in the new product development portfolio management in
companies? Four exploratory case studies were conducted, focusing on how each firm
conducted its portfolio management. Multiple sources of data were used: semi-structured
interviews with directors and managers; inspection of portfolio management process
documentation; observation of portfolio meetings; and a simulation exercise which
involved observing the approach managers took in selecting a product portfolio.
The findings show the existence of different routines in the portfolio management across
the four cases. These routines not only are the product of formal design initiatives, but
also ‘emerge’ from the daily activities of the company; as consequences, these routines
were not established in the form of formal rules and procedures. They nevertheless show
that companies which formally design routines and apply them to the portfolio
management processes produce more effective portfolio decisions.
A total of eight key routines could be identified, termed a ‘palette’ of routines from which
the routines relevant to a particular organization can be selected. While in the literature,
portfolio management is centered solely upon making decisions about which projects will
be selected, the palette of routines unveils the entire process of portfolio management as
more wide-reaching and complex. The palette of routines also contains connections
between the routines. The composition of these routines and the connections within them
form a portfolio management capability.
In terms of practical implications, these results provide companies with knowledge of a
generic framework for portfolio management. This framework can help managers design
their portfolio management process on the right routines, relevant to the company’s
context. These routines enable a company to facilitate the link between the mix of
projects chosen and its intended strategy.",,Brown T (2008) Design thinking. Harvard Business Review 86(6) 84–92.,"Calder BJ, Phillips LW et Tybout AM (1981) Designing research for application.

Identifying necessary conditions has attracted considerable interest in the product and
service innovation domain from practitioners and academics alike, as it supports problemsolving
and strengthens theoretical contributions. However, there appears to be a gap
between the relevance of necessity thinking and the methodological tools that have been
available for the empirical investigation of necessary conditions. Necessary Condition
Analysis (NCA) offers a novel methodological tool to close this gap – our objective is to
demonstrate the underlying necessity thinking present in product and service innovation
and to demonstrate the application of NCA that could be utilised as part of a future
research agenda on studying necessary conditions.
Brief literature mapping and key references
To shed light on necessary conditions and the product/service innovation outcomes that appear in
relevant academic discussions, first, a systematic review of necessity thinking enabled us to
identify commonly discussed outcomes and necessary conditions. Commonly discussed outcomes
include but are not restricted to product/service performance (e.g. Atuahene-Gima, 1995), product
advantage (e.g. Hua & Wemmerlöv, 2006), product success and failure (e.g. Avlonitis et al., 2001).
Some important factors discussed as necessary conditions are product superiority (e.g. Gruner et
al., 2018), customer knowledge (e.g. Bonner & Walker Jr, 2004), and familiarity (e.g. Maniak et al.,
2004).
Approach/Method
We apply necessity thinking (approach) and Necessary Condition Analysis (Dul, 2016) as the core
method of this study. Some further methods are also briefly reviewed but only from a necessity
perspective relevant to product and service innovation.
Theoretical development/research model/research questions
Our main research questions are how the product and service innovation could benefit from the
use of (1) necessity thinking and (2) Necessary Condition Analysis. We aim to outline theoryinformed
methodological and theoretical developments.
Data/Findings
To demonstrate how Necessary Condition Analysis can contribute to the empirical study of
necessary conditions, we use the illustrative case of R&D’s role in new product success. We use the
dataset of Rijsdijk and colleagues (2011) for this analysis.
Conclusion and contribution to the field
Our study makes three principal contributions. First, by identifying discussed necessary conditions
supported by a broad and multidisciplinary collection of studies, we bring much needed attention
to the underlying necessity thinking of innovation management. Second, aided by the illustrative
case of R&D, we provide hands-on guidelines for researchers on how to apply NCA. This includes
suggestions on interpretations specific to innovation management. Finally, we outline future
research directions to reveal potential necessary conditions in new product and service
development to be investigated by using Necessary Condition Analysis.
Managerial implications
The identification of necessary conditions will help managers to more efficiently allocate resources
across different ‘success factors’. This is especially interesting when it comes to investing into
activities/resources that are necessary to a desirable outcome but only in lower levels (similarly to
a pinch of salt that can mean success or failure to a meal).",,"Bianchi M, Marzi G and Guerini M (2018).

"TRIFILOVA, ANNA","ZHUPAROVA, AZIZA","BESSANT, JOHN",,,,,EXPLORING RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION IN DIGITAL PRODUCTS & SERVICES FOR HEALTHCARE,07 - Innovation Strategies and Leadership,"Objective: Our paper addresses the question of ‘responsible innovation’ (RI) and the scope for
its implementation in creating digital products and services for healthcare. In particular we
are interested in how far RI considerations can be enabled in the innovation process and in
relevant tools which might facilitate this.
Current understanding: ‘Digital healthcare’ products & services represent a powerful
innovation candidate for helping deal with the emerging healthcare crisis. But their
considerable potential also carries a risk that the underlying design of these applications
reflects a particular set of interests and viewpoints – a dominant logic. Under these conditions
alternative designs might be excluded as a trajectory emerges, which defines the form and
implementation mode of the technology. Innovations resulting from such a process might not
meet the needs or respond to the concerns of end-users - for example ‘smart’ homes, which
limit the autonomy of residents. Or privacy issues associated with misuse of electronic
medical records. Given this risk we suggest that concerns of responsible innovation in digital
healthcare could be raised.
RI can be defined as …’a transparent, interactive process by which societal actors and
innovators become mutually responsive to each other with a view to the (ethical) acceptability,
sustainability and societal desirability of the innovation process and its marketable products (in
order to allow a proper embedding of scientific and technological advances in our society) (Von
Schomberg, 2011).
Approach: Owen and colleagues offers a helpful framework for RI setting out key
questions which should be addressed in the development and implementation of innovations
(Stilgoe, Owen, & McNaghten, 2013)⁠. Four key areas are highlighted:
• Anticipation – describing and analysing those intended and potentially unintended
impacts that might arise, be these economic, social, environmental, or otherwise.
• Reflection - reflecting on underlying purposes, motivations, and potential impacts, and on
associated uncertainties, risks, areas of ignorance, assumptions, questions, and dilemmas.
• Deliberation – inclusively opening up visions, purposes, questions, and dilemmas to broad,
collective deliberation through processes of dialogue, engagement, and debate, inviting
and listening to wider perspectives from public and diverse stakeholders.
• Responsiveness – using this collective process of reflexivity to both set the direction and
influence the subsequent trajectory and pace of innovation.
We have adopted this framework as the basis for analysis of a variety of case studies (some
longitudinal in nature) in a major research programme exploring applications of digital
healthcare in Norway, the UK, The Netherlands, Brazil and the USA.
Research question: Two questions characterise our research:
• how far can RI be enacted in digital healthcare?
• how far can RI principles be enabled through the adoption of relevant tools ?
Findings: Our initial findings suggest there is considerable scope for widening the ‘design
space’ within these innovation processes and in particular for patient inclusion at an early
stage. But there is also evidence that the desire for inclusion varies widely along a spectrum
of patient involvement.
Practical implications: Much healthcare policy now carries a strong ‘patient inclusion’
rhetoric and our findings should help illuminate this discussion.","Von Schomberg,Rene (2011) ‘Prospects for Technology Assessment in a framework of responsible research and

"VALIBHAY, CHIPTEN ","LE MASSON, PASCAL ","WEIL, BENOIT",,,,,THE INVENTOR AND THE “PERSON SKILLED IN THE ART” – MANAGING THE INVENTION PROCESS BY MANAGING KNOWLEDGE,02. Design Issues and Innovation by Design,"The management of invention receives a growing interest in innovation
management literature. Due to the importance and accessibility of patent records,
researchers have extensively studied patents to better describe the invention
process (Altshuller, 1999; Youn et al., 2015; Alstott et al., 2017a). This approach has led
to the identification of creative mechanisms that is likely to produce would-be
invention – still without reliable evaluation of inventiveness. Recent works suggest
that the examination of the inventiveness of a solution mainly depends on the
structure and content of the state-of-the-art: a technical solution is “inventive” only
compared and evaluated against a given knowledge referential (Kokshagina et al.,
2017). If the inventiveness of a solution results from the relationship between the
state-of-the-art and the given solution, then the management of invention implies a
particular form of knowledge management that would allow a firm to build a
knowledge referential from which design engineers could build their inventions.
From this perspective, increasing a firm’s inventive capacity would depend on its
ability to properly manage its creativity but mainly in managing the knowledge and
expertise.
The aim of this paper is thus to explore the grounds to better characterize
how actors (IP attorneys, inventors) that are used to manage inventions select,
structure and manage their knowledge referential, and how different forms of
knowledge bases allow for different inventive capacity.
Brief literature mapping and key references
Patent design methods rely on inventive mechanisms applied to a set of
existing solutions (Koza et al., 2005; Hung and Hsu, 2007; Felk et al., 2011; Jeong and
Kim, 2014). However, the design of this set and its relationship to the solutions
generated is not discussed, which leads to uncertainty regarding the inventiveness of
the results. In innovation management literature, the relationship between
knowledge structures and inventive capacity of firms has revealed that the
organization of expertise is a key issue in inventive capacity (Henderson and Clark,
1990; Yayavaram and Ahuja, 2008; Alstott et al., 2017b). These analyses are ex-post
and as a result, the selection and structuration of the relevant state-of-the-art before
the invention process remains unexplored.
Approach/Method/Theoretical framework
For this study, we carried out a collaborative research with two classic actors
that manage inventions: 1) IP attorneys who position the inventions against specific
state-of-the-art, thus performing a selection of the state-of-the-art to build the
invention’s claims; 2) Inventors and patent engineers in firms with patent-oriented
strategies that has developed strong inventive capacity. Based on these case studies,
we used design theory framework (Hatchuel and Weil, 2009) to model the
knowledge structure used by these actors in their activities and its influence on the
forms of invention produced.
Research questions
Our two research questions are the following:
1) How to characterize and model the features of a proper state-of-the-art
adapted to the management of invention?
2) Can we better characterize or evaluate the existing patent design method
based on this model?
Main Findings, conclusion and contribution to the field
This article offers a modelling of the relationship between the structure of the stateof-
the-art and the forms of inventions that are built from this referential. It reveals
that there is not a unique definition of “invention” that would be independent of the
knowledge referential from which it was built (Arthur, 2007; Luo and Wood, 2017).
This result complements the literature on innovative design methods by identifying
three regimes of invention. Each of these regimes corresponds to a given knowledge
structure and specific inventive mechanisms related to this referential. Then, it
appears that a clear modelled state of the art could enable systematic invention.
Reversely and surprisingly, the use of invention methods could uncover or reveal
relevant state of the art and then drive and structure the acquisition of knowledge
for a group of inventors.
Managerial implications
The identification of the three regimes of invention allows to design a variety of
methods that could help firms to better steer their inventive activity. In particular,
this work suggests that there is a priori three different ways of structuring an
invention process to solve problems or identify inventive technics. Moreover, the
relationship between these methods and particular forms of knowledge
management would help firms to better manage their expertise in order to achieve
specific form of inventions.","Alstott, J., Triulzi, G., Yan, B., Luo, J., 2017a. Mapping technology space by normalizing

"VAN MALDEGEM, AGEETH",,,,,,,IDENTIFYING HOW SMES GENERATE DEEP CUSTOMER INSIGHTS FOR RADICAL INNOVATION,"05 - Innovation Management in Start-ups, Small Firms and Collaborative Enterprises","Although radical innovation is known for its positive influence on growth in small and medium-sized firms (SMEs) (Schindehutte, Morris and Kocak, 2008; Eggers et al., 2013), relatively few SMEs succeed in developing highly unique and valuable new products and services (OECD, 2010). One of the underlying causes might be a lack of insight into customers’ latent - unarticulated - needs. Such an insight is will be termed here a Deep Customer Insights (DCI), and they are widely recognized as an important prerequisite for radical innovation (see e.g. Cooper and Dreher, 2010; Coviello and Joseph, 2012). DCI need to emerge during the course of the innovation process (see e.g. Cooper, 2008; Hultink et al., 2011), and they require firms to depart from using just current, internal knowledge, and to absorb new customer knowledge (Kim and Atuahene-Gima, 2010). However, absorptive capacity (Cohen and Levinthal, 1990)⸺learning from external sources⸺, is known to be a problem for many SMEs (Maes and Sels, 2014).
With most of the extant research concentrating on large firm contexts or start-ups (see e.g. Coviello and Joseph, 2012), there is little guidance for SMEs on how to absorb external customer knowledge. The literature does explain certain aspects, such as entrepreneurial sense making processes (e.g. Bettiol, Di Maria and Finotto, 2011) or the role of networks (Jones, Suoranta and Rowley, 2013), but these studies do not give a complete understanding of how DCI can be generated. Extant studies also fail to establish a clear relationship between the type of customer insights generated (either current needs or latent needs) and the process by which they were achieved (see e.g. Coviello and Joseph, 2012). As a consequence, SMEs do not know how to generate DCI effectively.
Case study research based on practice theory (Schatzki, 1996) addresses this gap. The research focused on: 1) Identifying SMEs’ DCI practices; 2) The level of insights resulting from these practices; 3) Relevant perceptions of the actors. A literal and replication logic guided the selection of six SMEs. Data was collected by means of documents, interviews, surveys and a workshop, and these were systematically analysed using five different analysis instruments.
3
This paper makes a number of contributions to theory. First, it conceptualizes 13 distinct practices, bundles of activities, resources, and actors, that lead SMEs to customer insights. These practices refine current understanding on the modes of customer learning and show that SMEs do not confine to improvisation and trial-and-error, but consciously aim to increase customer understanding by means of data-collection and analysis activities as well. Second, the study proves that, despite the efforts put into customer learning, SMEs mostly create insights into current needs. The results have strong practical implications for managers in SMEs. They show that their inclination to allocate most learning resources to justification and testing of ideas does not result in deeper levels of customer understanding.","Bettiol, M., Di Maria, E. and Finotto, V.

"MARIA VAQUERO, MARTIN",,,,,,,CONSUMER PERCEPTIONS OF EXTERNAL PARTICIPATION IN NPD,"11 - Marketing, Markets and Users of Innovations","Literature, relevance and objectives
Approaches such as open innovation, lead user methods and customer integration propose that firms benefit from integrating external knowledge into NPD. The underlying assumption is that external input contributes to objectively better products (Nishikawa, et al., 2017). However, besides objective benefits, literature has recently drawn attention to a subjective effect of external contributions to NPD, particularly when external participants are users. These studies have shown that even if the products that a firm develops were not improved by user participation,
firms might still benefit from communicating user involvement (Dahl, Fuchs and Schreier, 2014, Fuchs and Schreier, 2011, Nishikawa, et al., 2017). In general, firms are perceived as more customer-oriented (Fuchs and Schreier, 2011), more innovative (Schreier, et al., 2012) and to have higher-quality ideas (Nishikawa, et al., 2017). Moreover, these perceptions translate into stronger behavioural intentions.
Interestingly, the effects of communicating co-creation practices with groups other than consumers has not been explored. I aim to close this gap by examining consumers’ reaction to the information that products are developed with input from different external sources.
Research model
The study focuses on two groups of participants in NPD: consumers and experts. Consumers might value the contributions from these groups for different reasons. While consumer input contributes to better fit between products and consumer needs, expert input can lead to higher quality products. In both cases, I expect firm and product innovativeness to be rated higher because new information and ideas flow into the process. In turn, I expect perceived customer orientation, perceived product quality and percieved innovativeness to mediate the influence of external participation in NPD on behavioural intentions.
Furthermore, I propose two moderators of the effect of external participation on consumer perceptions: the technological level of the products and the phase of NPD in which participation takes place.
Method
I rely on two between-subject on-line experiments with ten conditions: 2 (consumer vs. expert) x 2 (idea vs. product features) x 2 (high vs. low-tech) and two control groups. The first experiment (N=483, student sample) examines consumers perceptions of external participation in NPD at the product level. The second study (N=316, MTurk sample) examines firm-level effects.
Findings
Study 1 shows that communicating external participation in NPD does not influence consumers’ perceptions at the product level. If told that a product has been developed with external input, consumers do not perceive it to be significantly better along any of the dimensions. However, preliminary findings of study 2 show that communicating that a firm generally develops its products with external input, leads to higher perceived customer orientation in the case of user participants and that this translates into stronger behavioral intentions. Communication expert participation
leads to a higher perceived firm ability to develop high quality products, which in turn translates into stronger behavioral intentions in the case of high-tech products.
Conclusion and implications
This study contributes to understanding how firms might benefit from communicating NPD co-creation strategies to their benefit. When the analysis of study 2 is completed, it will shed light on the question of whether consumers value external contributions to NPD from different groups and when (i.e.: for what kinds of products and in what phase of NPD). Interesting theoretical and managerial implications can be derived from these findings.","Dahl, D.W., C. Fuchs and M. Schreier. 2014.

"VARNES, CLAUS",,,,,,,ORGANIZING FOR INNOVATION: RESOLVING THE COORDINATION-AUTONOMY DILEMMA WITH PERFORMATIVE EMPOWERMENT,16 - Organising New Product Development,"The key to successfully generating innovation for short and the long-term is exploration and
exploitation. The structural form of dealing with this quandary is to provide project teams with
autonomy but however at the same time abandoning managerial allocation of resources.
Autonomy is to some scholars, however, an individual construct; only existing in an isolated
and individual situation. A study of empowerment, therefore, based on the ontology of
Complex Adaptive Systems shows how the empowerment of individuals in innovation
becomes coordination. A longitudinal case study of an innovation department in a global and
sustainable company shows how a chaos (Stacey, 2011) of self-governing practices are an
effect of empowerment; not autonomy. Empirically, an expense account with ten percent of
the total innovation budget available for all employees, for instance, was never overspending
despite no requirement for preapproval; idea generation was successful with the formal
requirement that at least two colleagues needs to support the idea; many successful radical
ide-as occurring; project selection and performance evaluation of projects are equally selforganized
and only mediated by management who focus on acknowledgement and patternrecognition.
The key contribution, therefore, is the argument that the conflicting effects of
structural form on coordination and autonomy need to not to offset each other as
empowerment is performative and enables self-coordination of resources, idea generation,
and choice, among other innovation management elements. The department was entirely
reorganized changing e.g. the hierarchical formal power to horizontal to also enable conflicts
to occur. For the manager, this raises the issue of assumptions on human behaviour and to
organize for innovation, but also whether the institutionalized identity of the manager allows
for being out-of-control.",,"Beverland, M.B., Gemser, G., Karpen, IO. (2017), “Design, consumption, and

"VARNES, CLAUS",,,,,,,VALUE CROSSINGS IN THE SHARING ECONOMY,10 - Managing Sustainability in Innovation and Product Development,"While sharing has been used by humans as exchange for thousands of years, the scale
and wide reach enabled by platform technologies is new and have turned modes of being
an owner of property into modes of being a ‘business model manager’ in many big cities
among other places. Value creation is different in this new economy. Consumers seeks
private homes or cars endorsed by the owner and other consumers mediated by a
platform, but how is value created within these peer-to-peer new services?
Theoretically, the paper departs from Dewey’s notion of Value Practice (1939),
Karpik’s theory on value singaularization (2010), Boltanski and Thévenot (1991), and
also Christiansen et al. (2010). Value Practice is applied here of a study of two empirical
sharing-cases. 18 ethnographic interviews have been conducted in-situ and the
preliminary findings are reported in the tables below.
Cross-case analyses findings indicate four different value constructions: monetary,
safety, hospitality and social/experience. However, both analyses reveal that an economic
value construction cannot stand alone, but must be supported by a safety value
construction. These value constructions become stabilized as translation in juxtaposition
to an existing competing translation: that it is unsafe to share with strangers. Accordingly,
giving actors an economic incentive is not enough for them to enroll in the actor network,
but the company must also translate the action of sharing with strangers into a safe action.
Hence, a number of framing devices are introduced. These framing devices translate the
relation between users from a relation between strangers to a relation between
acquaintances, whereby the translation of sharing with strangers moves from unsafe to
safe. As this translation is facilitated by the company, and since the framing devices
introduced are features on the company platform, the company’s role as OPP is
reinforced. Hereby, sharing through sharing economic P2P-services is qualified as safe.
Accordingly, the analyses reveal that value in the sharing economy is not
constructed by separate value constructions. On the contrary, these value constructions
are connected and interrelated, as it is the case with the economic and the safety value
construction. Where the economic value construction makes the initial interessement of
actors, actors do not enroll in the network until a safety value construction has been
stabilized. Accordingly, the two value constructions must be seen as mutually dependent
for the construction of value in the sharing economy, and it is through their parallel
stabilization that an actor network can be established around sharing economic P2P
services.
The third value construction identified in both analyses is a hospitality value
construction. As opposed to the two previous value constructions, this value network is
not constructed around the company as an OPP, but directly in the relation between peer
user and peer provider when sharing. It stabilizes, as the peer provider does more than
what is expected of him/her on the basis of the money and the safety relation. Hereby, the
peer provider is translated into a host and the peer user into a guest.
As mentioned, the fourth identified value construction differs between the two
cases. That value constructions are not entirely the same across cases is not surprising. As
the two sharing economic services are very different in their offerings (transportation and
accommodation), distinct value constructions must be expected. However, the two value
constructions still reveal some similarities in how they are stabilized. Just like the
hospitality value construction, these two value constructions are not stabilized around the
company as the OPP, but again directly between peer user and peer provide when
sharing. In this value construction, the product being shared is a crucial actor for
stabilizing the relation; in the case of GoMore, the car creates a private or social sphere
translating the action of talking to strangers into a common behavior, whereby a social
relation is established. In the case of Airbnb, the home and its characteristics translate the
guest into a local and, not only Airbnb but, the entire vacation into an experience.
In the light of the cross-case results, it is possible to detect two different modes in
which value is constructed in the sharing economy.
The first mode value constructions are requisite for actors’ enrolment in the actor
world and, therefore, for the entire existence of the actor world. Moreover, first mode
value constructions are always established around the company as the Obligatory Passage
Point. This is evident in the economic value construction, where it is due to the company
platforms that peers can save and earn money and thereby ensure an economic value
construction to be stabilized. Moreover, it is evident in the safety value construction of
both cases, where it is features on the two company platforms assuring that sharing with
strangers is translated into a safe action. Consequently, actors must be associated through
the company platform for both a safety and an economic value construction to stabilize,
which inforces the companies’ roles as OPP. Thirdly, first mode value constructions are
what give an actor network its stabile characteristics, or at least what is perceived to be
stabile characteristics, since in reality these can always be challenged by other networks.
As revealed in the analyses, the simultaneous construction of safety and economic value
leads to the network being blackboxed and users no longer questioning their enrolment in
the network. This results in certain qualities being attached to the network. Accordingly,
due to first mode value constructions two core values or qualities are attached to the
sharing economy: cheap and safe.
The second group of value constructions is termed second mode value
constructions and is exemplified by the additional value constructions identified in the
two analyses: the hospitality, the social and the experience value construction. Shared for
this group of value constructions is the fact that they are not established around the
company as the OPP, but directly in the relation between peer provider and peer user
when sharing. As a consequence, second mode value networks are temporary value
constructions within the actor world associating certain heterogeneous actors only as long
as a product is being shared.
This temporality also holds the consequence that a certain set of stabile qualities
cannot be attached to this group, as it was the case with first mode value construction. On
the contrary, the qualities of second mode value construction are flexible and variable.
This is due to the fact that they are temporary constructions associating certain actors
only for a period of time within the network. As these actors are heterogeneous, so are the
second mode value constructions. This is for example seen in the case of Airbnb where
every home being shared, every homeowner renting out his/her place, and every guest
using the platform is different. Accordingly, the network stabilized though one process of
sharing over Airbnb is totally different from the network stabilized in another sharing
process. Consequently, the qualities of each second mode value construction will vary
and only be stable as long as that certain group of actors is associated.

"FRED WALI, ANDY","AWA UDUMA, IDIKA",,,,,,BREADTH OF OPEN INNOVATION AND SMES PRODUCT PERFORMANCE: THE MODERATING EFFECT OF TYPE OF INNOVATION,15 - Open Innovation,"Objectives and theoretical and practical relevance
The study investigates the influence of breadth of open innovation strategy on
product and service performance of UK SMEs and how the relationship is
affected by the type of innovation. It is almost a globally recognized fact that
small and medium-scale enterprises (SMEs) play pivotal roles in addressing the
unemployment situations, that are ravaging most economies of the world, through
their job creation potentials which has earned SMEs a recognition as the engine of
economic growth (Bruque & Moyano, 2007). In the UK, for instance, the number
of private sector businesses at the beginning of 2013 was estimated at 4.9 million,
employing 24.3 million people with combined turnover of £3,300 billion, of these
4.9 businesses, 99% were small (0–49 employees), 0.6% were medium (50–249
employees) and only 1% were large (250 or more employees). The total number
of employees directly employed in either a small or medium enterprise (SME) is
estimated at 14.4 million out of the 24.3 million total private sector employments.
This implies that about 2 out of every 3 private sector employees in the UK are
employed in an SME and the estimated combined turnover of the SMEs stands at
£1,600 billion (Business Innovation Skills [BIS, 2014,]). However, despite the
importance of SMEs in economic growth, many new ventures do not survive the
first few years of existence (Bollingtoft & Ulhoi, 2005), this is because it has been
observed that the fast-changing and increasingly competitive global market Zeng,
Xie, and Tam (2010) makes innovations for SMEs more complex (Diez, 2000).
 Brief literature mapping and key references
Open innovation is the use of purposive inflows and outflows of knowledge to
accelerate internal innovation and expand the markets for external use of
innovation (Chesbrough 2006; 2012). It comprises both outside-in and inside-out
movements of technologies and ideas, also referred to as “technology
exploration” and “technology exploitation” (Chesbrough & Crowther, 2006;
Lichtenthaler, 2008). Previous studies in the literature had found a positive
relationship between open innovation adoption and innovation performance
(Faems, De Visser, Andries, & Van Looy, 2010; Faems, Van Looy, & Debackere,
2005; Miotti & Sachwald, 2003; Nieto & Santamaria, 2007).
 Approach/Method
The respondents were 72 senior employees randomly sampled from SMEs in UK
manufacturing sector. We collected primary data using survey questionnaire.
 Theoretical development/research model/research questions
 Data/Findings
We found that breadth of open innovation have curvilinear relationship to both
incremental and radical product performance. Also, results showed that
incremental as well as radical innovation moderates the influence of breadth of
open innovation on the product performance.
 Conclusion and contribution to the field
 We concluded that adoption of optimum breadth of open innovation strategy
supports SMEs’ product-service performance.
 Managerial implications
We recommended that SMEs’ policy-makers should adopt a balanced breadth of
open innovation strategy in order to foster the achievement of their product
performance goals, depending on the particular type of innovation they intend to
achieve.",,"Barczak, G., Hultink, E. J., & Sultan, F. (2008). Antecedents and consequences of information technology usage in NPD: A comparison of Dutch and US companies.

"KATHARINA WIRTZ, SARAH","STERN, PHILIP","WRIGHT, MALCOLM","ZHANG, XIAOHUI",,,,MEASURING NEW PRODUCT TRIAL USING ANALOGOUS FORECASTING,"11 - Marketing, Markets and Users of Innovations","The need for managers to understand quickly whether or not to launch a product is crucial.
However, forecasting year-end cumulative trial from first quarter results is a common problem
in practice. A prediction of future success of new products is necessary, especially in early
stages of consumer trial. Even though this problem is extremely relevant in practice, research
on simple prognoses of success-relevant data for new products is still incomplete and lacking
(see Armstrong, 2001, p. 696, Principle 7.6) and the call for simplified techniques, that can be
used and understood by managers is obvious. Consequently, the aim of this work is to outline
a simple yet accurate technique to forecast consumer trial of new products over the first year of
sales using analogous series. Further, it extends previous works of Wright and Stern (2015)
from test markets to national markets and evaluates the results in a new context of consumer
non-durables using a fresh data set of new product launches from a UK company providing
additional confidence for the generalizability of the findings with further implications for
practice. Earlier research shows simple forecasting models perform well (Hardie et al., 1998;
Armstrong, 2001; Fader & Hardie, 2001; Meade & Islam, 2001) and analogous series provide
forecasts as accurate as more complicated statistical models (Wright and Stern, 2015).
Analogous series contain data that is expected to be related, with conceptual similarities and
affected by similar factors (Armstrong, 2001). Consumer trial is a simple metric used for the
evaluation of new product launches showing the proportion of consumers with at least one
purchase within a 52-week period after launch, characterized by early fluctuations. Thus,
analogous time series appear to be an appropriate form of analysis and present a simple tool
and benchmark for cumulative trial growth and a projection of year-end results under
consideration of excluding more complex behaviors (e.g. the effect of covariates).
Methodology
To make all cumulative trial curves comparable, figures are converted into proportions. The
ratio of a respective week x is calculated to the 52-week cumulative trial figure ensuring
normalization across each period. All available data is used to identify the analogous empirical
pattern:
Pj(t) = (1/n) Σ j=1 to n (pjt /pj52)
where Pj (t) = average proportion of a 52-week cumulative trial achieved by time t, for
the group of data sets j, where j varies from 1 to n; pjt = cumulative trial for new product
j at time t; pj52 = cumulative trial for new product j at week 52
For the assessment of forecasting performance accuracy, a modification is necessary omitting
the data under consideration of j = i, given the analogous pattern present in all data sets used to
forecast the focal data set:
Pi(t) = (1/n-1) Σ j=1 to n;j ≠ i (pjt /pj52)
For the calculation of forecast error, the following equation is applied:
Pi52 = pjt / Pj(t)
Implications
Currently insufficient data is available as to derive first results. Findings will be presented at
the conference upon successful submission. Because analogous series models detect time series
patterns that represent forecast values quite accurately they provide a simple method to predict
the total amount of consumers that try a brand in the first year after launch. Due to its simplicity
and accuracy it is suggested to find further usage in practice and as a matter of future research
it might help to provide guidelines disaggregating series into successful and unsuccessful
new product launches.","Armstrong, J.S. (2001). Standards and practices for forecasting. In J. Scott Armstrong (Ed.),

"BIRGIT WISSEL, JULIANE","ZAGGL, MICHAEL",,,,,,TACKLING DILEMMAS IN COMPANY-INVOLVED FREE/LIBRE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT - AN ORGANIZATIONAL PERSPECTIVE,15 - Open Innovation,"Companies are becoming more and more involved in the development of free/libre open source software (FLOSS) (Ho & Rai, 2017; Krogh et al., 2012). They use FLOSS in their products and contribute back to the respective communities in ways such as sponsorship, letting their developers take over managerial and administrative tasks inside the projects, or contributing code (Capra et al., 2009). The borders between companies and FLOSS communities become increasingly blurred. Companies and FLOSS communities need to constantly exchange information and therefore become mutually dependent. Depending on the degree of engagement with FLOSS communities, companies are confronted with different challenges. Companies which only use FLOSS, for example, have the lowest degree of engagement. Their main challenge is the decision when to purchase innovation in the form of proprietary software and when to rely on a comparable FLOSS solution. Companies with a higher degree of engagement, however, need to find an equilibrium between their independence and their collaboration with FLOSS communities (Ciesielska & Westenholz, 2016).
We approach these challenges on the organizational level and examine how companies manage their interactions with FLOSS communities. Specifically, we look at organizational measures companies introduce to ensure that no confidential information, including proprietary code, is released to the FLOSS communities. Furthermore, we investigate how the topic of FLOSS is embedded in the organizational structure and in the developers’ daily work.
We build our research on an inductive, grounded theory-based approach using interviews with company managers who are responsible for open source related topics. These include, for example, their companies’ involvement with FLOSS communities, strategy development, and legal compliance. Until now, 16 interviews with managers of large companies from different industries were conducted which resulted in a total of 13 hours of recording. Finally, we use documentation from FLOSS foundations and direct observations during open source related meetings with different organizations. These different sources represent a triangulated data collection.
Preliminary results show that most companies have a centralized FLOSS unit which provides support functions for all business units dealing with software. They act as centers of competence providing the infrastructure regarding FLOSS, including policies, processes, and tools. The implementation and engineering work fall within the responsibility of the business units, as well as the decision regarding which product features are realized through FLOSS and which ones through proprietary
software. As the developers are assigned to certain products, they usually deal with FLOSS and proprietary software simultaneously, which makes it necessary to ensure that no confidential information is brought into the FLOSS communities.
We identify three main measures the centralized FLOSS units set up to manage this security risk. First, many companies have a process that every planned contribution to a FLOSS community needs to go through. A combination of manual checking and the employment of automatic screening tools ensures that the contribution is legally compliant and does not contain any confidential information. Second, companies rely on training measures, mostly web-based, to impart basic knowledge among their employees about how to behave when collaborating with the communities. Finally, the FLOSS units provide online documentation around the topic, including wikis and codes of conduct which employees can consult.
Apart from these formal measures, we identify trust as an essential component when it comes to the interaction with FLOSS communities. Companies trust in their employees that they do not share confidential information. The longer an employee’s period of employment and the greater his expertise in FLOSS, the larger is the trust and the more freedom he has in the sense that not each of his contributions needs to go through the aforementioned process.
Our research contributes to the literature within institutional organizational theory on the intersection between companies and FLOSS development and to the literature on organizational design. We show how the topic of FLOSS is embedded in the organizational structure to enable company-involved FLOSS development and give insights into different measures taken to ensure that no confidential information is released to the FLOSS communities. Therefore, our research also provides practical implications for organizations that build on company-involved FLOSS development.","Capra, E., Francalanci, C., Merlo, F., & Rossi Lamastra, C. (2009).

"EWA WRÓBEL, AGATA","CASH, PHILIP","LOMBERG, CARINA",,,,,THE EFFECTS OF FACILITATOR’S NEUTRALITY ON EMERGENT STATES AND TEAM OUTCOMES,03 - Emerging and Early Research (Young Scholars Track),"Facilitation is a common practice in innovation management to support creativity and idea generation (Geschka, 1986), often used in early, creative project phases. These formative phases are critical for the subsequent project team development and performance (Ericksen and Dyer, 2004). However, little is known about the effects of external facilitator’s intervention on the team.
Research shows that emergent states, such as trust and cohesion, influence the execution and success of teamwork (Marks, Mathieu and Zaccaro, 2001). Since facilitation brings process and structure to team’s interactions (Schwarz, 2002), it is likely to have a moderating effect (Seeber, Maier and Weber, 2014). While several studies explored the relation between leadership and emergent states (e.g. Srivastava, Bartol and Locke, 2006), the impact of facilitation in this context is rarely studied. Unlike leaders, facilitators are often external to the organization and should remain neutral towards participants and content (Rasmussen, 2011), which implies different team dynamics and relationships.
This study examines how facilitator’s neutrality influences team’s emergent states and project outcomes. We conceptualize neutrality as consisting of impartiality and equidistance (Cohen, Dattner and Luxenburg, 1999). Impartiality is defined as lack of judgement about people and ideas. Equidistance means creating symmetry and content equality in the process. Since increasing symmetry requires judgement of information, we assume that high equidistance requires low impartiality, and high impartiality inhibits high equidistance.
We hypothesize that facilitator’s impartiality and equidistance have different effects on team trust, cohesion, potency, and members’ satisfaction with the final decision. To test these hypotheses, we conducted an experiment with 12 teams, each consisting of four randomly assigned Bachelor students, having one Master student as a facilitator. The Master-level facilitators were needed to ensure they are external and create hierarchy and authority.
The study was conducted as a design team challenge, including two different tasks to redesign given products. Each team carried out both tasks in a randomized order. In the first part, team members brainstormed ideas individually. The manipulation took place in the second, facilitated part of each task, where the teams had to discuss and make decision about their final concept. The facilitators, who were accordingly instructed, were manipulating these conditions. In the first set-up, we
tested for high equidistance and low impartiality. The facilitators used a structured approach to the decision-making process and stated their opinions and suggestions. In the second condition, low equidistance and high impartiality, the facilitators used an open approach, allowing free discussions, and refraining from stating opinions and judgments. Each team went through both conditions, in a randomized order. After each task, team members were asked to complete questionnaires about their perceptions of the team, the facilitator, and the final decision. All measures were 7-point Likert scales adopted from the literature. We controlled for age, gender, education, and working experience of the participants.
The experiment data is currently being analyzed and the final results will be presented in the paper. The study aims to contribute to theory by testing the link between facilitator’s neutrality and team’s emergent states. It highlights the importance of the facilitation process for team’s motivations and performance. From the managerial perspective, it clarifies whether and how engaging the external facilitator in the early project phases can influence teams, and gives means to design improved facilitation processes","Cohen, O., Dattner, N. and Luxenburg, A.

"SUNG YOON, BYUNG","JETTER, ANTONIE",,,,,,A PRODUCT DESIGN FACTOR MAPPING METHOD FOR THE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT PHASE,13 - New Methods and Methodological Issues in Innovation Research,"During concept development, product developers are increasingly expected to focus on product users and their future experience, in addition to cost, development and manufacturing efficiency, product function/quality, and differentiation of the product in the market. Development teams often struggle to address all of these considerations adequately, due to the following reasons: (1) Differences in technological and experiential knowledge and methods make it difficult for customers/user, marketing, and engineering to communicate effectively. As a result, important factors may not be sufficiently considered (Luo, Kannan, & Ratchford, 2008; Srinivasan, Lovejoy, & Beach, 1997). (2) Product design factors, including technological alternatives, functions, features and benefits, and customer value are interdependent: in some cases, customers are willing to sacrifice a feature for an improvement in another factor, in other cases, they only value a particular design factors if other factors are also present. Design factors can therefore only be understood in the context of other factors (Schröder & Jetter, 2003). However, current concept development methods fail to model the system of concept development decisions adequately. (3) The structural complexity of products hinders teams from assessing how a change impact all other design factors and future customer value, which can cause teams to ignore indirect effects and unintended consequences of product concept decisions (Kandjani & Bernus, 2011; Stevens, 2014).
This research therefore presents a novel method, based on cognitive mapping, which allows teams systematically, holistically, and iteratively assess alternative product concepts and their respective impact on customer value by modeling them as combinations of product design factors. Teams can thus identify and select product concepts that achieve high customer value, given existing constraints. The backbone of the method is fuzzy cognitive mapping. It allows the quantitative representation of group mental models from engineering, which represents knowledge of interdependencies between product features, technologies, and project objectives and from marketing and future product users, which represents knowledge of interdependencies between features, benefits, and value.
An experiment entailing a product development activity is carried out in order to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Multiple surveys investigates voluntary participants’ system knowledge (i.e. understanding of product design factors, the interdependencies, and their impact on customer preference) at different stages of the method through a workshop. The responses to the surveys are compared to observe the dynamic behavior of the participants’ system knowledge. Additionally, this paper will present the results of simulation and analysis of the individual and group mental models developed during the experiment.
The product design factor mapping method enables product development teams to gain a deeper understanding of the relationship between product design factors from a customer perspective, including subjective and emotional factors. Moreover, teams can use the model to identify value drivers and come up with concepts that further improve them while reducing factors that would decrease customer value. Lastly, the method allows teams to assess how this change propagates to other product factors and ultimately influences customer value, thus helping them to understand the impacts of their change decisions in a holistic manner.","Kandjani, H., & Bernus, P.

"ZELJKO, TEKIC",,,,,,,OPEN INNOVATION IN STARTUPS – WHY IS IT DIFFERENT?,15 - Open Innovation,"Ever since Chesbrough’s seminal paper (2003) and the introduction of the open innovation (OI) model, startups have been a part of the model and one of the key “mechanisms” to support open innovation. However, although the number of studies on open innovation has rapidly grown over the last 15 years (Huizingh, 2011; Bogers et al., 2017), only few studies have investigated the relationship between open innovation and startups, and even fewer open innovation in startups (Bogers et al., 2017; Spender et al., 2017). Moreover, most of these rare studies are characterized by the two main issues. First, the studies consider startups as “black box” entities, focusing on understanding the role and position these entities (“startups”) have in alliances (Neyens et al., 2010), networks (La Rocca and Snehota, 2014) and ecosystems (Ferrary and Granovetter, 2009), and how that is related to their innovativeness and survival (Spender et al., 2017). This approach led to the fact that by now, to the best of our knowledge, no study explored questions like: what open innovation practices do startups use; who are their main partners in OI; what are dominant reasons for startups to accept and practice OI; and when do they start with using OI practices? Second issue is that quantitative criteria—age and size (Eftekhari and Bogers, 2015; Neyens et al., 2010)—are almost exclusively used in the studies for defining that something is a startup. This assumption resulted in the misleading treatment of startups as younger and smaller copies of established companies (sometimes equalized with SMEs), preventing the exploration of questions, such as – how OI practices (partners, motives and timing) differ between startups and established companies (large, medium and small), if at all.
To address these two shortcomings of the extant research we examine practices used by startups through the lenses of the open innovation paradigm. We do it by conducting an inductive case study (Yin, 2009). We build on four cases involving B2B and B2C startups from different entrepreneurial ecosystems.
We find that primary motivation for startups to engage in open innovation is to validate a business model, as prerequisite for scaling-up. We find that startups use the range of open innovation practices and critically depend on them from early days of their existence. In the same vein like established companies, startups dominantly use nonpecuniary inbound type of OI. However, comparing to established companies, we find that startups use intensively some new and different OI practices (e.g. mentoring, MVP, peer-to-peer advices, acceleration, VCs feedback) and engage with new partners for OI (e.g. mentors, VCs, peers, accelerators). Finally, we find that level of openness is not dominantly determined by the size or age of a firm (as the most findings from the existing literature suggest) but by the stage at which an organization is in its search for a repeatable and scalable business model.
The paper makes two important contributions - it extends the open innovation model and conceptualizes startup using the model; and opens up the black box of open innovation practices in startups providing the first insights on their characteristics, and differences in comparison to those in established companies.
From a managerial perspective, our study instructs companies to structure and organize OI activities differently before and after business model is validated; and suggests that OI projects that target more radical results should be treated as startups, and thus managed less formally, including a range of new partners and practices.","Bogers, M., Zobel, A.
